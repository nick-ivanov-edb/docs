The Replication Server command line interface (CLI) is a command-line-driven alternative to the Replication Server console.

The steps for creating a replication system using the Replication Server CLI are the same as those required when using the Replication Server console. The logical components of the replication system must be created in the same order, with the same sets of attributes as when creating the replication system with the Replication Server console.

Before building a replication system using the Replication Server CLI, be sure you understand the concepts and steps presented in the [overview](../02_overview/#overview) and [Single-master replication operation](../05_smr_operation/#smr_operation) (for single-master replication) or [Multi-Master Replication Operation](../06_mmr_operation/#mmr_operation) (for multi-master replication). You can use both the Replication Server console and the Replication Server CLI to build and manage a replication system.

In [Replication Server CLI commands](03_xdb_cli_commands/#xdb_cli_commands), the syntax and examples given for each Replication Server CLI command run individually. Where applicable, the discussion of a command contains a reference back to its Replication Server console counterpart, where you can find a detailed description of the affected component and its attributes.
