Replication Server is a software product that lets you implement a *replication system*. A replication system is software and hardware whose purpose is to make a copy of data from one location to another and to ensure the copied data is the same as the original over time.

Replication Server applies the replication system concept to tables of Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server database management systems.
