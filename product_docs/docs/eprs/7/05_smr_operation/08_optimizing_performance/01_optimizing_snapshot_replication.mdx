You can set various configuration options to improve snapshot replication performance.

These options apply only to the publication server. You set them in the publication server configuration file unless otherwise specified.

`copyViaDBLinkOra`

When the `copyViaDBLinkOra` option is set to true, the Oracle database link API, `dblink_ora`, is used instead of JDBC `COPY` to populate EDB Postgres Advanced Server subscription tables from an Oracle publication during snapshot replication.

Oracle database link provides an additional performance improvement over JDBC `COPY`.

!!! Note
    The Oracle database link API feature isn't available with PostgreSQL, therefore the copyViaDBLinkOra option doesn't apply to PostgreSQL subscription tables.

!!! Note
    Prior to using `dblink_ora` with Replication Server, you must perform some required configuration steps in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 9.3 or earlier, see `README-dblink_ora_setup.txt` located in the `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/doc/contrib` directory for instructions. For EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 9.4 or later, see dblink_ora in the [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developerâ€™s Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/static/docs/epas/12/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Reference_Guide_v12.pdf).

`copyViaDBLinkOra={true | false}`

The default value is false.

`useFastCopy`

Set the `useFastCopy` option to `true` to skip write-ahead log (WAL) logging during `COPY` operations to optimize data transfer speed.

The `archive_mode` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file of the target Postgres database server must be off (thereby disabling archiving of WAL data) to use the `useFastCopy` option.

`useFastCopy={true | false}`

The default value is false.

`cpBatchSize`

Use the `cpBatchSize` option to set the batch size (in MB) to use in the JDBC `COPY` operation during a snapshot. Increase the value of this option for large publication tables.

This option is influential when Postgres is the subscription database since the JDBC `COPY` operation is used to load Postgres subscription tables.

This option has no effect when Oracle or SQL Server is the subscription database. To tune loading of Oracle or SQL Server tables, change the `batchSize` option.

`cpBatchSize=n`

The default value for n is 8.

`batchSize`

The `batchSize` option controls the number of `INSERT` statements in a JDBC batch.

This option is particularly important when Oracle or SQL Server is the subscription database since tables of these database types are loaded using JDBC batches of `INSERT` statements.

For a Postgres subscription database, tables are loaded using JDBC `COPY`. However, if the `COPY` operation fails, then table loading is retried using JDBC batches of `INSERT` statements as in the case of Oracle and SQL Server.

`batchSize=n`

The default value for n is 100.

`skipAnalyze`

Set the `skipAnalyze` option to true if you want to skip executing the `ANALYZE` command after loading Postgres subscription tables. The `ANALYZE` command gathers statistical information on the table contents. These statistics are used by the query planner.

`skipAnalyze={true | false}`

The default value is false.

`snapshotParallelLoadCount`

!!! Note
    To apply this option to a single-master replication system, you must set it for the subscription server in the subscription server configuration file. To apply this option to a multi-master replication system, set it for the publication server in the publication server configuration file.

The `snapshotParallelLoadCount` option controls the number of threads used to perform snapshot data replication in parallel mode. The default behavior is to use a single thread. However, if the target system architecture contains `multi-CPUs/cores`, you can specify a value greater than 1, normally equal to the `CPU/core` count, to fully use the system resources.

`snapshotParallelLoadCount=n`

The default value is 1.

`lobBatchSize`

If a table contains a column with a data type typically used for large objects such as BYTEA, BLOB, or CLOB, a heap space error is more likely to occur because of a potentially large amount of data (hundreds of MB) brought into memory. To minimize the chance of this error, a snapshot replication loads tables containing a large object data type, one row at a time using a single `INSERT` statement per batch.

If, however, the large object data type column is known to contain relatively small amounts of data, you can increase the speed of a snapshot replication by increasing the value of the `lobBatchSize` option to allow a greater number of rows (specified by n) in each batch.

`lobBatchSize=n`

The default value is 1.
