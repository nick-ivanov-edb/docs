You can configure and run Replication Server for single-master replication systems.

For configuration and management of your replication system, the Replication Server console interface is used to show the steps to use. You can perform the same steps from the operating system command line using the Replication Server command line interface (CLI). The commands of the Replication Server CLI are described in [Replication Server command line interface](../08_xdb_cli/#xdb_cli).
