<div id="quoted_identifiers" class="registered_link"></div>

A quoted identifier is an identifier created with its name enclosed in double quote characters ``(")``. The text enclosed in double quotes is stored as the object identifier name exactly as given, with no default case translation of alphabetic characters. Quoted identifiers occur in both Oracle and Postgres.

For example, `CREATE TABLE "MyTable"` produces a table name that's stored in the database systemâ€™s data dictionary as MyTable. References to this table must be made using an uppercase M, an uppercase T, and lowercase letters for the rest of the name.

If a database object is created without the double quotes surrounding its identifier name, default case translation of alphabetic characters occurs.

In Oracle, the default case translation is to upper case. For example, `CREATE TABLE MyTable` results in an object identifier name of `MYTABLE`.

In Postgres, the default case translation is to lower case. For example, `CREATE TABLE MyTable` results in an object identifier name of `mytable`.
