title: "Using prepared SQL statements"
---

When synchronization replication occurs, the changes recorded in the shadow tables are applied to the subscription tables in JDBC batch updates. In each batch, you can apply changes using either an individual SQL statement for each change, or you can can apply a set of changes using a single, prepared SQL statement. A prepared SQL statement is parsed and compiled only once, but you can execute it multiple times using different values for certain components of the SQL statement in each execution. A SQL statement that isn't prepared is parsed, compiled, and executed only once.

Prepared statements are useful only if the same type of SQL statement (`INSERT, UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) is executed repeatedly and consecutively with the same target table but with different values. If there's a sequence of consecutive changes that occur to the same table using the same operation such as inserting a set of rows into the same table populating the same columns, the publication server can apply these changes using a prepared statement. Otherwise, each change is applied with its own individual SQL statement.

A number of server configuration options control the characteristics of the JDBC batch along with if, when, and how often prepared statements are used. 

`defaultBatchUpdateMode`

The `defaultBatchUpdateMode` option controls whether the default mode uses individual SQL statements in the JDBC batch update (referred to as `BUS` mode) or to use prepared SQL statements in the JDBC batch update (referred to as `BUP` mode).

`defaultBatchUpdateMode={BUS | BUP}`

The default value is `BUS`.

`switchBatchUpdateMode`

The `switchBatchUpdateMode` option controls whether the publication server dynamically switches between `BUS` mode and `BUP  mode during the replication process. This switching depends on the type and sequence of updates it encounters in the shadow tables for the trigger-based method or the changeset stream for the log-based method.

`switchBatchUpdateMode={true | false}`

The default value is true.

Using the default settings of `defaultBatchUpdateMode=BUS` and `switchBatchUpdateMode=true`, the publication server starts out by applying updates with individual SQL statements. When it encounters a stream of consecutive changes that can all be processed in a single prepared statement, it switches to using prepared SQL statements.

!!! Note
    If you want a certain batch update mode used throughout all synchronization replications applied by a given publication server without switching update modes, set the `defaultBatchUpdateMode` option to the desired mode in combination with `switchBatchUpdateMode=false`. For example, if you want only prepared statements used, set the following options:

`defaultBatchUpdateMode=BUP`

`switchBatchUpdateMode=false`

!!! Note
    When Oracle is the subscription database, synchronization replication always occurs in `BUP` mode as if the preceding two options were always set. The reason for this is so that large columns of TEXT data type from Postgres publications can successfully replicate to Oracle CLOB columns. In `BUS` mode an individual Oracle SQL statement has a string literal maximum length of 4000 characters. This limitation doesn't occur for prepared SQL statements that are used in `BUP` mode.

`busBatchThresholdCount`

The `busBatchThresholdCount` option sets the number of consecutive updates of the same type that must be encountered in the shadow tables for the trigger-based method or the changeset stream for the log-based method before the publication server switches from `BUS` mode to `BUP` mode. This option applies if dynamic switching is permitted, that is `switchBatchUpdateMode=true`.

`busBatchThresholdCount=n`

The default value for n is 5.

The number of consecutive changes using the same table and SQL statement type must exceed the specified value n before a prepared statement is used.

Setting this threshold to a low value encourages higher use of prepared statements. Setting it to a high value limits the use of prepared statements.

If changes to the publication were made using many SQL statements, where each statement affected more than one row, then it might help to lower `busBatchThresholdCount`. Lowering this value encourages the use of prepared statements on the multiple shadow table rows resulting from each change on the publication.

`bupBatchThresholdCount and bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit`

If you use `BUP` mode but the number of updates using the same prepared statement is low, this configuration can cause frequent switches to a new prepared statement. In this case, it might be more helpful to use individual SQL statements (`BUS` mode).

For example, the following sequence of updates are better processed in `BUS` mode:

```text
INSERT INTO emp
INSERT INTO dept
INSERT INTO emp
INSERT INTO dept
DELETE FROM emp
UPDATE emp
UPDATE dept
INSERT INTO emp
INSERT INTO dept
DELETE FROM dept
INSERT INTO emp
DELETE FROM emp
INSERT INTO dept
```

However, in the following sequence, it is better to use `BUP` mode. Updates 1 through 3 are batched in one prepared statement, 4 through 7 in another prepared statement, 8 in its own prepared statement, and then 9 through 15 in one prepared statement.

```text
1. INSERT INTO emp
2. INSERT INTO emp
3. INSERT INTO emp
4. UPDATE dept
5. UPDATE dept
6. UPDATE dept
7. UPDATE dept
8. INSERT INTO emp
9. INSERT INTO dept
10. INSERT INTO dept
11. INSERT INTO dept
12. INSERT INTO dept
13. INSERT INTO dept
14. INSERT INTO dept
15. INSERT INTO dept
```

Use the `bupBatchThresholdCount` option with the `bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit` option to control the frequency of mode switches based on the volatility of expected update types to the publication.

`bupBatchThresholdCount=m`

The default value for m is 5.

`bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit=n`

The default value for n is 10.

Each time the same prepared SQL statement is consecutively executed, an internal `batch` counter is incremented. If this batch count falls below `bupBatchThresholdCount` for the number of executions of a given prepared statement, then a second internal `repeat` counter is incremented by one. If the repeat counter eventually reaches `bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit`, the update mode is switched from `BUP` to `BUS`.

Thus, if there are frequent, consecutive changes of prepared SQL statements (as measured against `bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit`), each of which is executed a small number of times (as measured against `bupBatchThresholdCount`), then the mode of execution changes back to individual SQL statements instead of prepared statements.

!!! Note
    The publication server changes back to prepared statements when the threshold set by `busBatchThresholdCount` is met.

The following example shows the processing of updates when `bupBatchThresholdCount` is set to 3 and `bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit` is set to 4. A change to the “query domain” referred to in this example means a different statement type (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) or a different target table are encountered in the next update. This condition requires the use of a different prepared SQL statement.

```
1.    INSERT INTO emp
2.    INSERT INTO emp
3.    INSERT INTO dept
```

At this point, the query domain is changed after the first two updates (change from table `emp` to `dept`), and the number of executions of the prior prepared statement (2) is less than `bupBatchThresholdCount`, so the repeat counter is set to 1.

```
4.    INSERT INTO dept
5.    INSERT INTO dept
6.    INSERT INTO dept
7.    INSERT INTO emp
```

The query domain is changed again (change from table `dept` to `emp`), but this time the number of executions (4) for the same query domain (updates 3 through 6) exceeds `bupBatchThresholdCount`. Thus the repeat counter is reset to 0.

```text
8.    INSERT INTO emp
9.    UPDATE emp
```

The query domain is changed again (`INSERT` statement to `UPDATE` statement), and the number of executions (2) is less than `bupBatchThresholdCount`, so the repeat counter is incremented to 1.

```text
10.   UPDATE emp
11.   INSERT INTO dept
12.   DELETE FROM dept
13.   INSERT INTO emp
```

The query domain is changed between updates 10 and 11, between updates 11 and 12, and between updates 12 and 13. At this point, the repeat counter was incremented three more times to a value of 4. This now equals `bupBatchThresholdRepeatLimit`, so processing is changed from `BUP` mode to `BUS` mode.
