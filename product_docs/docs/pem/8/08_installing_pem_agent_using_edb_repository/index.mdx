The PEM Agent that is installed with the PEM server is capable of monitoring multiple servers that reside on the same host, or on remote hosts. Please note that the PEM functionality on servers monitored by a remote Agent may be limited. For detailed information about remote monitoring functionality see the [PEM agent privileges](/pem/latest/pem_online_help/02_toc_pem_agent/05_pem_agent_privileges/).

For detailed information about installing and configuring a standalone PEM Agent on monitored hosts, see
