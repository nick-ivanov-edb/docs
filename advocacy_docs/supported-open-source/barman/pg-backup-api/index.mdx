Postgres backup API is a simple JSON-over-HTTP API for managing PostgreSQL backups.
It can be installed alongside Barman on the Barman server for cases where remote access to backup management features is required.

!!! Note
    Postgres backup API uses plain HTTP and provides no encryption or authentication out of the box.
    For secure access you will need to either integrate it with your existing infrastructure or follow our guide to [securing Postgres backup API](02-securing-pg-backup-api).
