When a publication is created in a single-master replication system, you can define the publication as a snapshot-only publication. Replication from a snapshot-only publication can be done only by using the snapshot replication method. Synchronization replication isn't permitted on a snapshot-only publication.

You can't create a snapshot-only publication in a multi-master replication system.

See [Performance considerations](../04_design_replication_system/04_performance_considerations/#performance_considerations) for a discussion of the advantages of using a snapshot-only publication.
