title: "Performing snapshot replication"

<div id="perform_replication" class="registered_link"></div>

You must perform the first replication using snapshot replication. After the first snapshot replication, you can perform later replications using either the synchronization method (if the publication wasn't initially defined as a snapshot-only publication) or the snapshot method.

1.  In the Replication Server console, select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to perform snapshot replication.

1.  Select **Subscription > Snapshot**. 

1.  Select **Verbose Output** if you want to display the output from the snapshot in the dialog box. Don't select this option in a network address translation (NAT) environment, as a large amount of output from the snapshot can delay the response from the Snapshot dialog box. 

1.  Select **Snapshot** to start snapshot replication.
    
    Snapshot Taken Successfully appears if the snapshot was successful. 

1.  Select **OK**. If the snapshot wasn't successful, scroll through the messages in the Snapshot dialog box  if **Verbose Output** was selected or check the log files.

The status messages of each snapshot are saved in the Migration Toolkit log files named `mtk.log[.n]` in the following directories. `[.n]` is an optional history file count if log file rotation is enabled. 

**For Linux:**

`/var/log/xdb-x.x`

**For Windows:**

`POSTGRES_HOME\.enterprisedb\xdb\x.x`

`POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the Windows postgres account (enterprisedb account for EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed in Oracle-compatible configuration mode). The specific location of `POSTGRES_HOME` depends on your version of Windows. The Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x`.

The publication is now replicated to the subscription database. A record of the snapshot is kept in the replication history. See [Viewing replication history](../../07_common_operations/04_view_replication_history/#view_replication_history) for more information.
