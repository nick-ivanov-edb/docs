After you create a subscription, you might later change aspects of the underlying replication system environment. Attributes that might change include:
-  The network location of the subscription database server
-  The network location of the host running the subscription server, database or operating system user names and passwords, and so forth

This information is saved in the replication system metadata when you create a subscription. Changes to these attributes result in inaccurate replication system metadata, which in turn can result in errors during subsequent replication attempts or replication system administration.

You can update the metadata stored for the subscription server, the subscription database definition, and subscriptions to keep the information consistent with the actual replication system environment.

!!! Note
    For managing a publication of a replication system, see [Managing a publication](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/#managing_publication).
