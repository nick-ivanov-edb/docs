You can use the zypper package manager to install the connector on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EDB. Before installing the connector, use the following commands to add EDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

 `zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo`

After creating the repository configuration files, use the `zypper refresh` command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EDB repositories.

When prompted for a `User Name` and `Password`, provide your connection credentials for the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit [the EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components, you must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

 `zypper install SUSEConnect`  
 `SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'`  
 `SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64`  
 `SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64`

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit the [SUSE website](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626).

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install the connector:

`zypper install edb-odbc`

`zypper install edb-odbc-devel`
