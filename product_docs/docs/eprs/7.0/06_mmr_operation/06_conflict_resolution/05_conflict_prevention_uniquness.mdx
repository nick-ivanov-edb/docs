Since there's no automatic built-in resolution strategy for the uniqueness conflict, you can use strategies to avoid this problem. These strategies are implemented by the DBA. This discussion is based on a realm of numeric values generated by a sequence such as for a unique primary key.

The following are possible strategies:

-   **Node-specific sequence range**. A sequence range is reserved for each primary node. For example, primary node A has `MINVALUE = 1` and `MAXVALUE = 1000`, primary node B has `MINVALUE = 1001` and `MAXVALUE = 2000`, and so on for other nodes. This mechanism ensures that a unique ID is always generated across all primary nodes.
-   **Start-value variation**. Each node is assigned a different start value. For example, primary node A has a `START` value of `1`, node B has a value of `2`, and node C has a value of `3`. An increment greater than or equal to the number of nodes guarantees unique IDs, as shown in the table that follows.
-   **Common sequence**. All nodes share a common sequence object. However this approach has the major disadvantage of slowing down transaction processing due to network round trips associated with each ID generation.
-   **MMR-ready sequence**. This technique enhances the use of sequences and provides a more flexible, reliable approach for a distributed, multiple database architecture as is inherent in a multi-master replication system. This approach is recommended over the other sequence techniques. See [Conflict prevention with an MMR-ready sequence](06_conflict_prevention_mmr_ready/#conflict_prevention_mmr_ready) for more information.

|   Sequence Clause  |   Primary node A   |   Primary node B   |   Primary node C   |   |
|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---|
|   START WITH       |   1                |   2                |   3                |   |
|   INCREMENT BY     |   5                |   5                |   5                |   |
|   Generated IDs    |   1, 6, 11, 16, …  |   2, 7, 12, 17, …  |   3, 8, 13, 18, …  |   |
