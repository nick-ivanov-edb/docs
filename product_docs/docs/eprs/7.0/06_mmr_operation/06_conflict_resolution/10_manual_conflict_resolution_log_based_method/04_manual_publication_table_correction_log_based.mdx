<div id="manual_publication_table_correction_log_based" class="registered_link"></div>

The first step required in all manual conflict resolutions is to ensure all publication tables are consistent across all primary nodes. All corresponding tables must have the same rows with the same column values.

Once this state is achieved, you can then reapply transactions that failed to replicate successfully.

In the example shown in [Correction strategies](03_overview_correction_strategies_log_based#overview_correction_strategies_log_based), the inconsistencies are the following:

-   Primary nodes `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b` each contain a row with primary key value `50`, but the other column values in the row are different.
-   Primary node `MMRnode_c` doesn't have a row with primary key value `50`.

Assuming that the correct state of the dept table is the one in `MMRnode_b`, you can use one of the following options to correct the state of all primary nodes:

-   Manually correct the dept table in `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`. That is, update the row in `MMRnode_a` so it has the correct values, and insert the missing row in `MMRnode_c`. The dept table on all nodes is then consistent and up to date.
-   Manually delete the row with primary key value `50` from the table on both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`. This brings the dept table on all primary nodes back to a prior, consistent state. Then, with the multi-master replication system running, perform the insert transaction again using the correct column values on any one of the primary nodes.

After the publication table rows are corrected, update the appropriate control schema table in the publication database currently designated as the controller database to indicate that the conflict was resolved.

The method outlined by the first bullet point is accomplished as follows.

**Step 1:** Manually correct the rows in the publication tables with SQL statements incorporated in a transaction block as described in [Conflict resolution concept for the log-based method](02_conflict_resolution_for_log_based/#conflict_resolution_for_log_based).

On `MMRnode_a`, correct the erroneous row by running the following transaction block:

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
  WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
UPDATE edb.dept SET dname = 'MARKETING', loc = 'LOS ANGELES'
  WHERE deptno = 50;
COMMIT;
```

This is shown by the following:

```text
MMRnode_a=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
MMRnode_a=# UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_a=# UPDATE edb.dept SET dname = 'MARKETING', loc = 'LOS ANGELES'
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE deptno = 50;
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_a=# COMMIT;
COMMIT
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM edb.dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, insert the missing row with the following transaction block:

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
  WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
INSERT INTO edb.dept VALUES (50,'MARKETING','LOS ANGELES');
COMMIT;
```

This is shown by the following:

```text
MMRnode_c=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
MMRnode_c=# UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_c=# INSERT INTO edb.dept VALUES (50,'MARKETING','LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_c=# COMMIT;
COMMIT
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM edb.dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The dept table on `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c` now match the content of the table on `MMRnode_b`:

**Step 2:** In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entry in the xdb_conflicts table to indicate the conflict was resolved. Table xdb_conflicts is located in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`.

!!! Note
    The entries in table xdb_conflicts affect only the data that appears in the **Conflict History** tab and the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../09_manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method/01_find_conflict/#find_conflict). Changing entries in xdb_conflicts does not affect future replication operations but provides a way to keep a record of how past conflicts were resolved.

Note the following regarding the xdb_conflicts table:

-   A row in the xdb_conflicts table appears as an entry in the **Conflict History** tab.
-   The primary key of the xdb_conflicts table is made up of columns `src_db_id`, `target_db_id`, `src_rrep_sync_id`, and `target_rrep_sync_id`. `Column src_db_id` contains a unique identifier for the primary node in which a transaction occurred that results in a conflict when replicated to the primary node identified by `target_db_id`. `src_rrep_sync_id` is the identifier of the transaction on the source primary node involved in the conflict. `target_rrep_sync_id` is the identifier of the transaction on the target primary node involved in the conflict. 

  !!! Note
    The ``src_rrep_sync_id`` and ``target_rrep_sync_id`` values are used internally by Replication Server. You don't need them for the manual conflict resolution process.

-   Table xdb_pub_database in the control schema associates the database identifiers `src_db_id` and `target_db_id` with the primary node attributes such as the database name, IP address, and port.
-   Column `table_id` is the identifier of the publication table where the conflict occurred. Association of the `table_id` value with the publication table attributes such as its name and schema is found in each primary node in `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tables`.
-   Column `pk_value` contains text indicating the primary key value that resulted in the conflict. The text is formatted as `column_name=value`. If the primary key is composed of two or more columns, each column and value pair is separated by the keyword AND, such as `column_1=value_1 AND column_2=value_2`. This provides the primary key of the row in the publication table designated by `table_id` that resulted in the conflict.
-   Column `resolution_status` indicates the status of the conflict. Possible values are `P` (pending) or `C` (completed: the conflict was resolved). This status appears in the Resolution Status column of the **Conflict History** tab.
-   You can use column `win_db_id` to record the database identifier of the primary node that contains the winning (accepted) transaction. This information appears in the Winning DB column of the **Conflict History** tab.

## Pending uniqueness conflict

For this example, you can find the entry for the pending insert/insert conflict on the `deptno` primary key value of `50` in xdb_conflicts with the following query:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
MMRnode_a-#     AND conflict_type = 'II'
MMRnode_a-#     AND resolution_status = 'P';
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+--------------------------
src_db_id           | 1
target_db_id        | 22
src_rrep_sync_id    | 44713808
target_rrep_sync_id | 44718040
table_id            | 31
conflict_time       | 21-AUG-15 15:34:55.134171
resolution_status   | P
resolution_strategy |
resolution_time     |
alert_status        |
conflict_type       | II
win_db_id           | 0
win_rrep_sync_id    | 0
notes               |
pk_value            | deptno=50
```

This entry appears in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

## Pending conflict in xdb_conflicts

Change the value in column `resolution_status` from `P` (pending) to `C` (completed) to indicate this conflict was resolved. Change the value in `winning_db_id` to `22` to indicate primary node `MMRnode_b` contains the winning transaction.

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_a` to the `MMRnode_b` synchronization conflict is:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 22
WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
    AND conflict_type = 'II'
    AND resolution_status = 'P';
```

When viewed in the **Conflict History** tab, the entry now shows `Resolved` instead of `Pending` in the Resolution Status column, and the Winning DB column shows the address of primary node `MMRnode_b`.
