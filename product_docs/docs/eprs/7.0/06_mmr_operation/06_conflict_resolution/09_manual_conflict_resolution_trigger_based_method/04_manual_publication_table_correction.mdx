title: "Manual publication table correction"

<div id="manual_publication_table_correction" class="registered_link"></div>

The first step in all manual conflict resolutions is to ensure all publication tables are consistent across all primary nodes. That is, all corresponding tables have the same rows with the same column values.

After that, you can then reapply transactions that failed to replicate successfully.

Using the example from [Correction strategies](overview_correction_strategies/#example_replication_environment), the inconsistencies are the following:

-   Primary nodes `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b` each contain a row with primary key value `50`, but the other column values in the row are different.
-   Primary node `MMRnode_c` doesn't have a row with primary key value `50`.

Assuming that the correct state of the dept table is the one in `MMRnode_b`, the following options are available to correct the state of all primary nodes:

-   Manually correct the dept table in `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`. That is, update the row in `MMRnode_a` so it has the correct values, and insert the missing row in `MMRnode_c`. The dept table on all nodes is now consistent and up to date.
-   Manually delete the row with primary key value `50` from the table on both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`. This brings the dept table on all primary nodes back to a prior, consistent state. Then, with the multi-master replication system running, perform the insert transaction again using the correct column values on any one of the primary nodes.
-   Manually delete the incorrect row with primary key value `50` from the table on `MMRnode_a`. Leave the correct row in the table in `MMRnode_b`. This simulates the state where the correct transaction was run on `MMRnode_b`, is recorded in the shadow table, but has not yet been replicated, and the incorrect transaction was never run on `MMRnode_a`. Update the shadow table entry in `MMRnode_a` to indicate that it is discarded and to ensure it isn't included in any future synchronizations. Update the metadata for the shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` to force its inclusion in the next synchronization. Perform a synchronization replication so the accepted shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` is replicated to `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`.

After the publication table rows are corrected, update the appropriate control schema table in the publication database currently designated as the controller database to indicate that the conflict has been resolved.

**Step 1:** Manually correct the rows in the publication tables with `session_replication_role` set to `replica`. On `MMRnode_a`, correct the erroneous row:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
session_replication_role
--------------------------
replica
(1 row)

MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)


MMRnode_a=# UPDATE dept SET dname = 'MARKETING', loc = 'LOS ANGELES' WHERE deptno = 50;
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, insert the missing row:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)


MMRnode_c=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The dept table on `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c` now match the content of the table on `MMRnode_b`:

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

**Step 2:** Update the shadow table entries for the conflicting transactions in the primary nodes to indicate that the conflict was resolved. In each primary node where a transaction occurred that's involved in the conflict, inspect the shadow table for the publication table in question. Shadow tables are located in each primary node in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`. Shadow tables follow the naming convention `rrst_schema_table` where `schema` is the name of the schema containing the publication table and `table` is the name of the publication table.

Note the following points regarding shadow tables:

-   A row in a shadow table corresponds to an `INSERT, UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement that's applied to the corresponding publication tables in the other primary nodes. A shadow table row doesn't necessarily correspond to the SQL statement issued by the user application. For example, a SQL statement issued by a user application that includes a `WHERE` clause using a range such as greater than or less than results in multiple, individual entries in the shadow table for each row in the result set of the applicationâ€™s SQL statement.
-   The primary key of a shadow table is a program-generated positive integer in `column rrep_sync_id`. The `rrep_sync_id` values are unique among all shadow tables in a given primary node. Therefore, the `rrep_sync_id` values for conflicting transactions might not have the same value across primary nodes. This depends on how many prior transactions were recorded in the shadow tables of each primary node.
-   A shadow table entry for a transaction involved in a conflict that wasn't yet resolved contains a value of `P` (pending) in column `rrep_tx_conflict_status`. If a transaction isn't involved in a conflict, this column is set to null. (Most shadow table entries have null in this column.) If a transaction was involved in a conflict that was resolved automatically by the publication server, and this transaction was accepted as correct, this column contains `C` (complete/accepted). If a transaction was involved in a conflict that was resolved automatically, and this transaction was deemed incorrect, this column contains `D` (discarded).

To find the shadow table entries involved in a conflict, use the **Conflict History** tab in the Replication Server console or the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../10_manual_conflict_resolution_log_based_method/01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict) and shown by the following output:

```text
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
conflict_type       | II
table_name          | dept
pk_value            | deptno=50
src_db_host         | 192.168.2.22

target_db_name      | MMRnode_b
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
-[ RECORD 2 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
conflict_type       | II
table_name          | dept
pk_value            | deptno=50
src_db_host         | 192.168.2.22
src_db_port         | 5444
src_db_name         | MMRnode_b
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_db_host      | 192.168.2.22
target_db_port      | 5444
target_db_name      | MMRnode_a
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
```

You can then query the shadow table in the desired primary node on its `rrep_sync_id` value.

The following query is performed on the shadow table for the dept table in `MMRnode_a` on `rrep_sync_id` value 2 obtained from field `src_rrep_sync_id` of RECORD 1 in the preceding output.

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept WHERE rrep_sync_id = 2;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----------+--------------------------
rrep_sync_id            | 2
rrep_common_id          |
rrep_operation_type     | I
rrep_tx_timestamp       | 25-AUG-15 11:39:35.590648
deptno                  | 50
dname                   | FINANCE
loc                     | CHICAGO
rrep_old_deptno         |
rrep_old_dname          |
rrep_old_loc            |
rrep_tx_conflict_status | P
```

A similar query can locate the pending shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` by querying on the key value obtained from field `src_rep_sync_id: of RECORD 2:`

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept WHERE rrep_sync_id = 1;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----------+--------------------------
rrep_sync_id            | 1
rrep_common_id          |
rrep_operation_type     | I
rrep_tx_timestamp       | 25-AUG-15 11:39:57.980469
deptno                  | 50
dname                   | MARKETING
loc                     | LOS ANGELES
rrep_old_deptno         |
rrep_old_dname          |
rrep_old_loc            |
rrep_tx_conflict_status | P
```

!!! Note
    To be certain no pending transactions are overlooked, examine the shadow tables in all primary nodes that might be involved in the conflict, and search for entries where `rrep_tx_conflict_status` is set to `P`.

The following shows the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column marked `P` (pending) in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

![Shadow table entry with pending conflict](../../../images/image146.png)

Modify column `rrep_tx_conflict_status` by changing the value to `D` (discarded) to show that the pending conflict was resolved. A value of `D` also ensures that the shadow table entry isn't replicated during any future synchronization replications.

Make this change to the shadow tables in both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`.

![Discarded shadow table entry](../../../images/image147.png)

Be sure to qualify the row with the correct `rrep_sync_id` value if you perform the update using a SQL statement such as in the following:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept SET rrep_tx_conflict_status = 'D' WHERE rrep_sync_id = 1;
```

There's no shadow table entry in `MMRnode_c`, since an insert transaction wasn't performed in that primary node by the application.

**Step 3:** In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the `xdb_conflicts table` to indicate the conflict was resolved. Table `xdb_conflicts` is located in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`.

!!! Note
    The entries in table xdb_conflicts affect only the data that appears in the **Conflict History** tab and the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../10_manual_conflict_resolution_log_based_method/01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict). Changing entries in `xdb_conflicts` has no effect on future replication operations but provides a way to keep a record of how past conflicts were resolved.

Note the following points regarding the `xdb_conflicts` table:

-   A row in the `xdb_conflicts` table appears as an entry in the **Conflict History** tab.
-   The primary key of the `xdb_conflicts table` is made up of columns `src_db_id`, `target_db_id`, `src_rrep_sync_id`, and `target_rrep_sync_id`. Column `src_db_id` contains a unique identifier for the primary node in which a transaction occurred that results in a conflict when replicated to the primary node identified by `target_db_id`. `src_rrep_sync_id` is the shadow table identifier of the transaction on the source primary node involved in the conflict, while `target_rrep_sync_id` is the shadow table identifier of the transaction on the target primary node involved in the conflict. For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts, the `target_rrep_sync_id` value is always set to `0`. For a given uniqueness conflict, there are two entries in the `xdb_conflicts table`. The `src_rrep_sync_id` value in each of the two entries corresponds to the shadow table identifiers. One is for the shadow table identifier associated with the source primary node. The other is for the shadow table identifier associated with the target primary node.
-   Table `xdb_pub_database` in the control schema associates the database identifiers `src_db_id` and `target_db_id` with the primary node attributes such as the database name, IP address, and port.
-   Column `table_id` is the identifier of the publication table on which the conflict occurred. Association of the `table_id` value with the publication table attributes such as its name, schema, and shadow table is found in each primary node in `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tables`.
-   For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, column `pk_value` contains text indicating the primary key value that resulted in the conflict. The text is formatted as `column_name=value`. If the primary key is made up of two or more columns, each column and value pair is separated by the keyword AND, such as `column_1=value_1 AND column_2=value_2`. This provides the primary key of the row in the publication table designated by `table_id` that resulted in the conflict. Only uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts contain the `column_name=value` text in the `pk_value` column. The `pk_value` column is null for all other conflict types (that is, update/update, delete/update, update/delete, and delete/delete conflicts).
-   Column `resolution_status` indicates the status of the conflict. Possible values are `P` (pending) or `C` (completed, that is the conflict was resolved). This status appears in the Resolution Status column of the **Conflict History** tab.
-   You can use the column `win_db_id` to record the database identifier of the primary node that contains the winning (accepted) transaction. This information appears in the Winning DB column of the **Conflict History** tab.
-   You can use column `win_rrep_sync_id` to record the shadow table identifier of the winning transaction.

The following shows the **Conflict History** tab prior to updating the `xdb_conflicts` table.

![Pending uniqueness conflict](../../../images/image145.png)

You can find the conflict entry for synchronization from `MMRnode_a` to `MMRnode_b` in `xdb_conflicts` with the following query for this example:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE src_db_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_db_id = 4

                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
 pk_value            | deptno=50
```

You can find the conflict entry for synchronization from `MMRnode_b` to `MMRnode_a` in xdb_conflicts with the following query for this example:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE src_db_id = 4
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_db_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND src_rrep_sync_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
src_db_id           | 4
target_db_id        | 1
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
table_id            | 31

notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                   |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
pk_value            | deptno=50
```

For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, you can use the following query to display both of the preceding entries:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
MMRnode_a-#     AND conflict_type = 'II'

   pk_value            | deptno=50
```

These entries appear in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

Change the value in column `resolution_status` from `P` (pending) to `C` (completed) to indicate this conflict was resolved. The value in `winning_db_id` changes to `4` to indicate primary node `MMRnode_b` contains the winning transaction. The value in `winning_rrep_sync_id` changes to the value of `rrep_sync_id` for the shadow table entry of the transaction in `MMRnode_b`, since this is the one deemed correct.

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_a` to the `MMRnode_b` synchronization conflict is the following:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE src_db_id = 1
  AND target_db_id = 4
  AND src_rrep_sync_id = 2
  AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
```

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_b` to the `MMRnode_a` synchronization conflict is the following:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE src_db_id = 4
  AND target_db_id = 1
  AND src_rrep_sync_id = 1
  AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
```

For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, you can use the following SQL statement to update both of the preceding entries at the same time:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
  AND conflict_type = 'II'
  AND resolution_status = 'P';
```

The following are the updated xdb_conflicts entries:

![Resolved conflict in xdb_conflicts](../../../images/image149.png)

When viewed in the **Conflict History** tab, the entries now show Resolved instead of Pending in the Resolution Status column, and the Winning DB column shows the address of primary node `MMRnode_b`.
