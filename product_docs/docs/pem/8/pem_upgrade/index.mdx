This guide provides detailed information about upgrading the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) Components:

-   **Upgrading a PEM Installation** -  Provides information about upgrading your PEM Server, PEM Agent and SQL Profiler from one major version to another.
-   **Upgrading the PEM Backend Database** - Provides detailed information about upgrading the backend database, while maintaining the same version of the PEM Server.
-   **Upgrading SQL Profiler** - Provides detailed information about upgrading the SQL Profiler.
-   **Moving the PEM Server** – Provides detailed information about moving the PEM Server from one host to another host.
-   **Troubleshooting** – Provides detailed information about troubleshooting the errors that you may encounter during PEM upgrade.

This document uses the term `Postgres` to mean either the PostgreSQL or the Advanced Server database or EDB Postgres Extended (formerly known as 2ndQPostgres).

!!! Note
    If you are upgrading PEM 7.x to the latest version and the PEM backend database is PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 10 or earlier then follow these steps:
    1.  Upgrade the PEM backend database
    2.  Upgrade the PEM Installation

    If the PEM backend database is PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Sever version 11 or later then upgrading the PEM backend database is optional.
