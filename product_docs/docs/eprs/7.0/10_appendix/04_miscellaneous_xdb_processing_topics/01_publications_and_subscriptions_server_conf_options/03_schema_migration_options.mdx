!!! Note
    This option applies only to the subscription server.

This option controls how certain aspects of the publication database schema are migrated to the subscription database.

## skipCheckConst

By default, column ``CHECK`` constraints from publication tables are migrated to the subscription table definitions when the subscription is created. Set this option to `true` if you don't want ``CHECK`` constraints as part of the subscription table definitions.

Setting this option to `true` is useful if the ``CHECK`` constraint is based on a built-in function supported by the publication database server, and this built-in function doesn't exist in the subscription database server.

`skipCheckConst={true | false}`

The default value is `false`.
