<div id="where_to_look_for_errors" class="registered_link"></div>

You can look in a number of places to find more detailed information about a replication error. 

## General replication status

In the Replication Server console, view the replication history. See [Viewing replication history](../../07_common_operations/04_view_replication_history/#view_replication_history).

<div id="snapshot_replication_failures" class="registered_link"></div>

## Snapshot replication failures

View the log file found in the following path:

**For Linux:**

`/var/log/xdb-x.x/mtk.log`

**For Windows:**

`POSTGRES_HOME\.enterprisedb\xdb\x.x\mtk.log`

`POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the Windows postgres account (enterprisedb account for EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed in Oracle-compatible configuration mode). The specific location of `POSTGRES_HOME`  depends on your version of Windows. The Replication Server version number is represented by x.x.

See [Controlling logging level, log file sizes, and rotation count](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/01_controlling_logging_level/#controlling_logging_level) for more information on setting log file options.

## Synchronization replication failures

Check the database server log file.

The typical default location of these files is:

`POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/data/pg_log`

<div id="pub_and_sub_startup_failures" class="registered_link"></div>

## Publication and subscription server startup failures

View the publication server and subscription server log files `pubserver.log[.n]` and `subserver.log[.n]` in the following directory:

**For Linux:**

`/var/log/xdb-x.x`

**For Windows:**

`POSTGRES_HOME\.enterprisedb\xdb\x.x`

`[.n]` is an optional integer suffix whose presence depends on the `logging.file.count` configuration option described in [Controlling logging level, log file sizes, and rotation count](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/01_controlling_logging_level/#controlling_logging_level).

`POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the Windows postgres account (enterprisedb account for EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed in Oracle-compatible configuration mode). The specific location of `POSTGRES_HOME` depends on your version of Windows. The Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x`.

!!! Note
    You can control the severity level of messages logged in these files using a configuration option. See [Controlling logging level, log file sizes, and rotation count](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/01_controlling_logging_level/#controlling_logging_level).

**For Linux only:** View the publication service and subscription service startup log files `edb-xdbpubserver.log` and `edb-xdbsubserver.log` as well as the service script log files `edb-xdbpubserver_script.log` and `edb-xdbsubserver_script.log` in directories `/var/log/edb/xdbpubserver` and `/var/log/edb/xdbsubserver`. These log files contain the output from the scripts used to start the publication server and subscription server and can typically be used to confirm the port number on which the publication and subscription servers were started.

!!! Note
    The publication service and subscription service startup log files aren't generated for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.

If there's an entry for a controller database in the Replication Server configuration file, verify that this controller database is accessible with the designated connection information. The controller database parameters are `host, port, type, user`, and `password`.

The following is an example of the content of a Replication Server configuration file with an Oracle database as the controller database:

```text
#xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
#Tue May 26 13:45:37 GMT-05:00 2015
port=1521
admin_password=ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw\=\=
user=pubuser
admin_user=admin
type=oracle
password=ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw\=\=
database=xe
host=192.168.2.23
```

See [Replication Server configuration file](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file)  
for information on this file.

Also check the database server log file of the controller database.

## Database server errors

Check the database server log file.

The typical default location of these files is:

`POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/data/pg_log`

## Oracle Errors

For problems in Oracle, first find the directory locations of the log files by issuing the following commands in SQL\*Plus:

```text
SQL> SHOW PARAMETER USER_DUMP_DEST;

NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
user_dump_dest                       string      /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/
                                                 admin/XE/udump
```

The directory given by parameter `USER_DUMP_DEST` contains errors given by user processes.

```text
SQL> CONNECT system/password
Connected.
SQL> SHOW PARAMETER BACKGROUND_DUMP_DEST;

NAME                                 TYPE        VALUE
------------------------------------ ----------- ------------------------------
background_dump_dest                 string      /usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/
                                                 admin/XE/bdump
```

The directory given by parameter `BACKGROUND_DUMP_DEST` contains errors given by the Oracle background processes.

Find the latest log file in the preceding directories to investigate the problem.
