title: Connecting your cloud from BigAnimal
---

To successfully connect your cloud accounts to BigAnimal:

1. [Set up your identity provider]()
1. [Import users]()
1. [Set up your cloud]()

## Set up your identity provider

The user who is setting up the IdP is assigned the default role of an *Account Owner* in BigAnimal. Perform either of the following procedures to connect your IdP using the SAML protocol.

In the **Setting up your IdP in BigAnimal** page, specify the following information:

- **Issuer URL**: URL string uniquely associated with your Identity Provider partner.
- **Single Sign-On URL**:
- **Identity provider signature certificate**: Identity provider's assertion signing certificate (.cer or .cert). Coordinate with your identity provider partner to obtain this certificate securely.

- **Request Binding**: SAML Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send the authentication request i.e. HTTP or HTTP POST
- **Response Signature Algorithm (RSA) Algorithm**: The signature algorithm used to sign the SAML AuthNRequest i.e. SHA or SHA-256

Click **Next** to download the metadata file to configure BigAnimal in your IdP environment. 

!!! Note

    While configuring the SAML response, ensure that the SAML repsonse is configured correctly. **Provide more details here (TBD)**.


## Import users

A user who is added in the IdP is automatically added to BigAnimal. Users are typically invited by the IdP and BigAnimal assigns them with the default role of ‘reader’ (which will become Organization Member after Projects is released). You can then manage roles and permissions from BigAnimal, see [Managing portal access](../../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/) 

!!! Note
    
    A user is only created in BigAnimal once they have logged in. If they have never logged in, they won’t show up in the user list and therefore their BigAnimal role can’t be changed (until they log in).

Before users become visible in the BigAnimal **Users** screen, they need to sign in using Azure AD after receiving special emails from your organization. New users signed in to BigAnimal have a minimum set of permissions until you assign them a role.


## Set up your cloud

EDB provides a shell script that checks whether requirements and resource limits are met in your cloud before linking to BigAnimal. An account owner or any other user can run EDB's setup script.

When you first log into BigAnimal:

1. Open the cloud shell in your browser.

1. Run the following command:

 **For Azure**

 **For AWS**

1. Input your cloud provider and account ID or subscription ID. The script sets up the boundary policy, designates the role and access BigAnimal should have to your Cloud Provider, and checks and raises account limits as needed.
