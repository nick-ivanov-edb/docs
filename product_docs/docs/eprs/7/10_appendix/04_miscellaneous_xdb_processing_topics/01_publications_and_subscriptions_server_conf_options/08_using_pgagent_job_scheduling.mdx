!!! Note
    This option applies only to the publication server.

!!! Note
    Using pgAgent job scheduling is useful only if Postgres is the publication database.

!!! Note
    You must have pgAgent installed and running on the host where the publication database resides.

When the `pgdbschedule` option is set to `true`, Replication Server uses the pgAgent job scheduler instead of the default Quartz job scheduler.

When activated, pgAgent takes over the following scheduling tasks from Quartz:

-   Scheduling shadow table history cleanup in the publication database. See [Scheduling shadow table history cleanup](../../../07_common_operations/05_managing_history/#schedule_shadow_table_history_cleanup).
-   Scheduling transaction set creation. A transaction set creation job is scheduled to run every hour to create transaction sets from the updates on the source tables. Transaction sets are applied to the target tables.

Unlike the Quartz scheduler, pgAgent can run and perform its tasks even if the publication server isn't running.

`pgdbschedule={true | false}`

The default value is `false`.
