These configuration and maintenance operations of Replication Server are common to both single-master and multi-master replication systems.

For configuration and management of your replication system, the Replication Server console is used to illustrate steps and examples. You can perform the same steps from the operating system command line using the Replication Server command line interface (CLI). The commands of the Replication Server CLI utility are described in [Replication Server command line interface](../08_xdb_cli/#xdb_cli).
