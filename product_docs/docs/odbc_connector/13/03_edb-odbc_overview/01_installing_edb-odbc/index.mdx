title: "Installing EDB-ODBC"

---

The EDB ODBC Connector is distributed and installed with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server graphical or RPM installer.

## Installing the Connector with an RPM Package

You can install the ODBC Connector using an RPM package on the following platforms:

-   [RHEL 7 x86-64](#rhel7)
-   [RHEL 7 ppc64le](#centos7_PPCLE)
-   [RHEL 8 x86-64](#rhel8)
-   [RHEL 8 ppc64le](#on-rhel-8-ppc64le)
-   [CentOS 7 x86-64](#centos7)
-   [Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8 x86-64](#centos8)


### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing EDB ODBC connector RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-odbc`

     `yum upgrade edb-odbc-devel`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-odbc`

     `dnf upgrade edb-odbc-devel`

## Installing the Connector on an SLES Host

You can install the ODBC Connector on the following SLES platforms:

- [SLES 12 x86-64](#on-sles-12-x86_64)
- [SLES 15 x86-64](#on-sles-15-x86_64)
- [SLES 12 ppc64le](#on-sles-12-ppc64le)
- [SLES 15 ppc64le](#on-sles-15-ppc64le)
