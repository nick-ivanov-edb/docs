Before following the detailed instructions that install the PEM server on your specific platform, you must perform the prerequisite steps detailed in [Prerequisites for installing PEM Server](01_prerequisites_for_installing_pem_server/#prerequisites_for_installing_pem_server).

On a Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux system, you can use the `yum` package manager or `dnf` command to install a PEM Server; the installation tool you use will be dependent on the version of the host operating system. Before installing the server, you must ensure that your system contains the required prerequisite software listed below.

**Install the `epel-release` package**

```text
dnf -y install epel-release
```

**Enable the powertools repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it**

```text
dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
```

**Install and Configure the edb.repo File**

To create an EnterpriseDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the `<username>` and `<password>` of a registered EDB user:

```text
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

**Disbale the built-in PostgreSQL module**

```text
dnf -qy module disable PostgreSQL
```

**Install the PEM Server**

After meeting the platform-specific prerequisites listed above, you can use dnf to install the PEM Server:

```text
dnf install edb-pem
```

!!! Note
    The operating system user `pem` gets created while installing the PEM Server. The PEM Server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session gets saved to this user's home directory.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

If you want to install PEM server on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](04_creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network/#creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network).

After installing PEM Server using `yum` or `dnf`, you need to configure the PEM Server. For more detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux platforms](05_configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).
