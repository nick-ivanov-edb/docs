Before you begin manual resolution correction, first determine the extent of the inconsistencies that occurred in the publication tables across the primary nodes of the replication system.

The **Conflict History** tab in the Replication Servier console and the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_find_conflict/#find_conflict) can help determine the source of an initial conflict.

However, once this conflict occurs, your replication system might have processed and replicated more transactions during that synchronization operation. Some of these later replications might have succeeded, but others might have failed or produced unexpected results because of the prior conflict. With a replication schedule in effect, more synchronization operations can occur, which can create more conflicts.

Therefore, when you learn that a conflict occurred, we recommend that you stop the publication server. Use the stop option of the Linux scripts or Windows services described in [Registering a publication server](../../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server).

In this way, you can carefully analyze the content of the publication tables in question as well as any pending transactions in the shadow tables. This approach helps you to determine the best course of action without continued updates by the running replication system.

When analyzing your tables. you must determine the following:

-   The publication tables that contain inconsistent rows across primary nodes (that is, missing rows on some primary nodes or rows with different column values for the same primary key on different primary nodes).
-   Pending transactions in the shadow tables not applied to the publication tables across all primary nodes. Pending transactions are denoted by a value of `P` in the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column of the shadow table.
-   Transactions on the publication tables that have occurred and are recorded in the shadow tables following the initial conflict. Also determine whether these transactions were applied completely and correctly to the publication tables across all primary nodes. These transactions might not be marked as pending. Instead, their `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column might be set to null, meaning that no conflict was detected during replication or the transaction wasn't replicated yet. You can identify these transactions because they have a later `rrep_tx_timestamp` value than the transactions causing the initial conflict.

The general steps to resolving the problem following this analysis are the following:

1.  Make the needed manual corrections to the rows in the publication tables across all primary nodes to get them into an initial, consistent state so each publication table has the same set of identical rows across primary nodes. This might be to a state before the conflicting transactions occurred, depending on what you determine to be the easiest course of action for fully resolving the conflict.

1.  Apply or reapply transactions (either from your application or from the shadow tables) so that all publication tables across all primary nodes are updated consistently according to the desired, expected result of what was recorded in the shadow tables.

1.  In the shadow tables, update certain indicators for conflicting entries to verify that they were resolved.

1.  In the control schema, update certain indicators for the conflicting entries to show that these conflicts were resolved. This update changes the Resolution Status of these entries to Resolved in the **Conflict History** tab. These entries no longer appear in the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_find_conflict/#find_conflict).

     Perform these updates to the control schema of the controller database. You can determine the currently designated controller database from the content of the Replication Server configuration file (see [Replication Server configuration file](../../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file)). The publication server ensures that the control schema changes made on the controller database are replicated to the control schemas of all publication databases. This mechanism maintains metadata consistency across all publication databases.

1.  Resume operating your replication system. Start the publication server and recreate the replication schedule if you were using one.

To acheive the first two steps, use some combination of the following methods. The methods you use depend on the state of your publication tables and the extent of pending transactions that need to be applied from the shadow tables.

-   **Manual publication table correction.** Use a utility such as PSQL or pgAdmin (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server) to manually correct the rows in the publication tables across all primary nodes without replicating these changes. Use the database user with `session_replication_role` set to `replica` for this purpose.
-   **Correction using new transactions.** Rerun your application on one primary node to create new transactions that can replicate to all other primary nodes. Use this method after you ensure that all publication tables are in a consistent state across all primary nodes.
-   **Correction using shadow table transactions.** Force the synchronization of transactions already recorded in the shadow tables. Use this method if many shadow table transactions need to be applied and it's simpler to force the synchronization of these transactions rather than reissuing the transactions from your application.

## Example replication environment

In the examples that follow, the following replication environment is used.

-   A three-node multi-master replication system is established. The primary node names are `MMRnode_a` (the primary definition node and the controller database), `MMRnode_b`, and `MMRnode_c`.
-   The publication is named `emp_pub` and uses dept and emp tables.
-   The conflict used to show the first two conflict resolution methods is a uniqueness conflict occurring on the dept table on primary key column `deptno` on value 50. This conflict resulted from the `INSERT` statements shown by the following:

On `MMRnode_a`, the following statement is run:

```text
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'FINANCE', 'CHICAGO');
```

On `MMRnode_b`, the following statement is run:

```text
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
```

A synchronization replication is then performed.

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_a`:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)
```

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_b`:

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_c`:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

The **Conflict History** tab shows the following entry:

The following is the output from the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_find_conflict/#find_conflict).
