title: Connecting your cloud
---

To successfully connect your account to BigAnimal:

1. [Import users from your organization]()
1. [Run EDB's setup script]()
1. [Assign roles to users]()

## Import users from your organization

Open the page for setting up your identity provider (IdP) with the link provided in EDB customer care's oboarding email. Perform either of the following procedures to connect your IdP using SAML.

The user who is setting the IdP up will have the default role of *Account Owner* in the BigAnimal. 

### Method 1: Manually register your IdP in BigAnimal using a SAML metadata file

In the **Setting up your IdP in BigAnimal** page, specify the following information:

- **Domain Name**: SAML Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send the AuthNRequest i.e. HTTP or HTTP POST
- **SAML** or **OIDC**: Authentication protocol used by your identity provider.
- **Issuer URI**: URI string uniquely associated with your Identity Provider partner.
- **Signing certificate**: Identity provider's assertion signing certificate (.cer or .cert). Coordinate with your identity provider partner to obtain this certificate securely.
- **Request Binding**:
- **Response Signature Algorithm (RSA) Algorithm**: The signature algorithm used to sign the SAML AuthNRequest i.e. SHA or SHA-256

Click **Next** to download the metadata file to configure BigAnimal in your IdP environment. 

!!! Note

    While configuring the SAML response, ensure that the SAML repsonse is configured correctly. **Provide more details here (TBD)**.


### Method 2: Confirming your domain 

Add and verify your domain to confirm ownership of the domain. Your domain routes all login requests from users (with your domain name in their email addresses) to the correct login page. 

1. Configure a new application for BigAnimal using the SSO URL and Audience URI in your SAML IdP. 

1. Sign in to your domain name provider and add a verification key in a DNS txt record. In BigAnimal verify that your personal record is present and assigned to your domain. 

Each DNS record associates an organization with a domain. This also means that users can only access multiple BigAnimal Organizations by using different emails with different domains. Users e.g. contractors, who need such access need an email with the correct domain to access each Organization; they will have multiple BigAnimal logins, one for each Organization.  

When users are done filling out the onboarding form, BigAnimal tests whether the information provided is correct. BigAnimal displays messages to help you troubleshoot in case of any errors. 

## Importing users

Any user who is added to the group in the IdP will be automatically added to BigAnimal. Users are invited by the IdP are assigned with the default role of ‘reader’ (which will become Organization Member after Projects is released). BigAnimal roles can be managed through the BigAnimal UI, see [Managing portal access](..administering_cluster/01_portal_access/) 

!!! Note
    
    A user will only be created and show up in the BigAnimal UI once they have logged in. If they have never logged in, they won’t show up in the user list and therefore their BigAnimal role can’t be changed (until they log in).

Before users become visible in the BigAnimal **Users** screen, they need to sign in using Azure AD after receiving special emails from your organization. New users signed in to BigAnimal have a minimum set of permissions until you assign them a role.


## Run EDB's setup script

After completing the IdP setup, the user will be redirected to the portal and can log into BigAnimal immediately. 

EDB provides a shell script that checks whether requirements and resource limits are met in your cloud and links to BigAnimal. The Account Owner can run EDB's setup script or import other users to run the script, see [Importing users](#importing-users).

When you first log into BigAnimal:

1. Open the cloud shell in your browser.

1. Run the following command:

 **For Azure**

 **For AWS**

1. Input your cloud provider and account ID or subscription ID. The script sets up the boundary policy, designates the role and access BigAnimal should have to your Cloud Provider, and checks and raises account limits as needed.
