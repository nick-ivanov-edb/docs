<div id="enable_filters_on_subscription" class="registered_link"></div>

You must first define table filters in a set of available table filters in the publication before you can enable them on a subscription. See [Adding a publication](../02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for information on defining table filters in a single-master replication system.

To enable or disable table filters on an existing subscription:

1.  Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication associated with the subscription you want to change is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a publication server](../02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for instructions on starting and registering a publication server. 

1.  Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you want to change is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a subscription server](../03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for instructions on starting and registering a subscription server.

1.  Select the Subscription node of the subscription on which you want to enable or disable individual filter rules.

1.  Select **Subscription > Update Filter Rule**.

1.  In the Filter Rules dialog box, select options to specify the filter rules to enable or disable on the subscription. You can enable at most one filter rule on any given subscription table. 

1.  Select **Update**.

    A confirmation box appears with a warning message and a recommendation to perform a snapshot replication to any subscription on which you changed the filtering criteria.

1.  To proceed with the update to the filter rule selections, select **OK**.

1.  When the update is complete, Filter Rules Updated Successfully appears.

1.  We recommend that you perform a snapshot replication on the subscription that contains tables on which you changed the filtering criteria.

    A snapshot ensures that the content of the subscription tables is consistent with the updated filtering criteria. See [Performing snapshot replication](../04_on_demand_replication/01_perform_replication/#perform_replication) for details.
