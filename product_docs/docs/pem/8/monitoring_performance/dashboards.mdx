## Using dashboards to view performance information

PEM displays performance statistics through a number of dashboards; each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs and tables that display the statistics related to the selected object.

The PEM client displays the `Global Overview` dashboard when it connects to the PEM server. Additional dashboards provide statistical information about monitored objects. These include the:

**Alerts Dashboard**

The Alerts dashboard displays the currently triggered alerts. If opened from the Global Overview, the dashboard displays the current alerts for all monitored nodes on the system; if opened from a node within a server, the report will reflect alerts related to that node, and all monitored objects that reside below that object in the tree control.

**Audit Log Analysis Dashboard**

For Advanced Server users, the Audit Log Analysis dashboard allows you to browse the audit logs that have been collected from instances that have audit logging and collection enabled.

**BDR Admin Dashboard**

The BDR Admin dashboard displays the overview of information about BDR node, BDR group, and BDR worker.

**BDR Group Monitoring Dashboard**

The BDR Group Monitoring dashboard displays the information about BDR group Subscription and BDR group replication slots.

**BDR Node Monitoring Dashboard**

The BDR Node Monitoring dashboard displays the information about BDR node slots, BDR node Replication rates, and BDR conflict history summary for the selected node. 

**Database Analysis Dashboard**

The Database Analysis dashboard displays performance statistics for the selected database.

**I/O Analysis Dashboard**

The I/O Analysis dashboard displays I/O activity across various areas such as object DML activity, log operations and more.

**Memory Analysis Dashboard**

The Memory Analysis dashboard supplies statistics concerning various memory-related metrics for the Postgres server.

**Object Activity Analysis Dashboard**

The Object Activity Analysis dashboard provides performance details on tables/indexes of a selected database.

**Operating System Analysis Dashboard**

The Operating System Analysis dashboard supplies information regarding the performance of the underlying machineâ€™s operating system.

**Probe Log Analysis Dashboard**

The Probe Log Analysis dashboard displays any error messages returned by a PEM agent.

**Server Analysis Dashboard**

The Server Analysis dashboard provides general performance information about the overall operations of a selected Postgres server.

**Server Log Analysis Dashboard**

The Server Log Analysis dashboard allows you to filter and review the contents of server logs that are stored on the PEM server.

**Session Activity Analysis Dashboard**

The Session Activity Analysis dashboard provides information about the session workload and lock activity for the selected server

**Session Waits Analysis Dashboard**

The Session Waits Analysis dashboard provides an overview of the current DRITA wait events for an Advanced Server session.

**Storage Analysis Dashboard**

The Storage Analysis dashboard displays space-related metrics for tablespaces and objects.

**System Waits Analysis Dashboard**

The System Waits Analysis dashboard displays a graphical analysis of system wait information for an Advanced Server session.

**Streaming Replication Analysis Dashboard**

The Streaming Replication Analysis dashboard displays statistical information about WAL activity for a monitored server and allows you to monitor the status of Failover Manager clusters.

There are two ways to open a dashboard; you can:

-   Select an active dashboard name from the `Dashboards` menu (accessed via the Management menu).
-   Right click on the name of a monitored object in the tree control and select the name of the dashboard you would like to review from the Dashboards menu.

Each dashboard is displayed on the `Monitoring` tab in the main panel of the client window. After opening a dashboard, you can navigate to other dashboards within the same tab.

Each dashboard header includes navigation menus that allow you to navigate to other dashboards; use your browsers forward and back icons to scroll through previously-viewed dashboards. Use the Refresh icon to update the current dashboard.

Options on the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog allow you to link the time lines of all of the line graphs on the dashboard. To open the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog, click the Settings icon displayed in the dashboard header.

Use fields on the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog to control attributes of the charts displayed on the dashboard:

-   Set the Link timelines of all the line charts slider to Enable to indicate that the specified timeline should be applied to line graphs displayed on the dashboard; if set to Disable, your preferences will be preserved for later use, but will not modify the amount of data displayed.
-   Use the `Days` selector to specify the number of days of gathered data that should be displayed on line graphs.
-   Use the `Hour(s)` selector to specify the number of hours of gathered data that should be displayed on line graphs.
-   Check the box next to Remember configuration for this dashboard to indicate that the customized time span should be applied to the current dashboard only; if left unchecked, the time span will be applied globally to line graphs on all dashboards.

Please note that settings specified on the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog are applied only to the current user's session.

## Managing custom dashboards

PEM displays performance statistics through a number of system-defined dashboards; each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs and tables that display statistics related to the selected object. You can use the `Manage Dashboards` tab to create and manage custom dashboards that display the information that is most relevant to your system.

![The Manage Dashboards tab](../images/manage_dashboard_tab.png)

To create a custom dashboard, click the `Create New Dashboard` link (located in the Quick Links section of the Manage Dashboards tab).

To modify an existing dashboard, click the edit icon to the left of a dashboard name. The dashboard editor will open, displaying the definition of the dashboard. When you've finished modifying the dashboard's definition, click the `Save` button to preserve your changes; click `Cancel` to exit without saving your changes.

To delete a dashboard, click the delete icon to the left of a dashboard name. A popup will ask you to confirm that you wish to delete the dashboard; click `OK` to delete the selected dashboard.

### Creating a custom dashboard

You can use the PEM dashboard editor to create or modify a user-defined dashboard. The custom dashboard may include pre-defined charts, user-defined charts or a mix of pre-defined and user-defined charts.

![The Create Dashboard editor](../images/pem_custom_dashboard_configure_dashboard.png)

Use the fields in the `Configure` section to specify general information about the dashboard:

-   Specify a name for the dashboard in the `Name` field. The name specified will also be the title of the dashboard if the title is displayed.
-   Use the `Level` drop-down listbox to specify the level of the PEM hierarchy within the PEM client on which the dashboard will be displayed. A dashboard may be accessed via the Dashboards menu on a Global level, an Agent level, the Server level or the Database level. Each selected level within the list will expose a different set of metrics on which the custom dashboard's charts may be based.
-   Provide a description of the dashboard in the Description field.

Provide information in the fields in the `Ops dashboard options` box if the dashboard will be used as an Ops dashboard:

-   Set the `Ops Dashboard?` field to Yes to instruct the server to create a dashboard that is formatted for display on an Ops monitor.
-   Set the `Show Title?` field to Yes to display the dashboard name at the top of the Ops dashboard.
-   Use the `Font` drop-down list box to select a custom font style for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the Preview box.
-   Use the `Font size` drop-down list box to select a custom font size for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the Preview box.

Use the `Permissions` box to specify the users that will be able to view the new dashboard:

-   Set the `Share with all slider` to Yes to instruct the server to allow all Teams to access the dashboard, or set Share with all to No to enable the Access permissions field.
-   Use the `Access permissions` field to specify which roles can view the new dashboard. Click in the field, and select from the list of users to add a role to the list of users with dashboard access.

When you've completed the `Configure Dashboard` section, click the arrow in the upper-right corner to close the section, and access the `Dashboard Layout Design` section.

![Specifying placement details for a chart](../images/pem_custom_dashboard_chart_details.png)

Use the chart detail selectors to specify placement details for the chart:

-   Use the `Chart width` selector to indicate the width of the chart; select 50% to display the chart in half of the dashboard, or 100% to use the whole dashboard width.

-   Use the `Chart alignment` selector to indicate the position of the chart within the section:

    Select `Left` to indicate that the chart should be left-justified.

    Select `Center` to indicate that the chart should be centered.

    Select `Right` to indicate that the chart should be right-justified.

Please note that tables are always displayed centered.

When creating or editing a custom dashboard, you can use drag and drop to re-arrange the charts within a section or to move a chart to a different section.

To add another chart to your dashboard, click the add icon (+) in the section header. When you've finished editing the dashboard, click the `Save` button to save your edits and exit.

To exit without saving your changes, click the `Cancel` button.

### Creating an Ops dashboard

You can use the PEM dashboard editor to create a custom dashboard formatted for display on an Ops monitor. An Ops dashboard displays the specified charts and graphs, while omitting header information and minimizing extra banners, titles, and borders.

![Ops dashboard options](../images/define_ops_dashboard.png)

To create an `Ops dashboard`, provide detailed information about the Ops display in the `Ops dashboard options` section of the `Create Dashboard` dialog.

-   Set the `Ops Dashboard?` field to `Yes` to instruct the server to create a dashboard that is formatted for display on an Ops monitor.
-   Set the `Show Title?` field to `Yes` to display the dashboard name at the top of the Ops dashboard.
-   Use the `Font` drop-down list box to select a custom font style for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the `Preview` box.
-   Use the `Font size` drop-down list box to select a custom font size for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the `Preview` box.

After adding charts and tables to the Ops dashboard, click the `Save` button to save your work. You can then access the dashboard by navigating through the Dashboards menu of the hierarchy level specified in the `Level` field on the `New Dashboard` dialog.
