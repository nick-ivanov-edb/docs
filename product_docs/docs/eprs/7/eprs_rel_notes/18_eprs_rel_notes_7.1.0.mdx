New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.1.0 include the following:

| Type        | Description |
| ----------- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Replication Server is now certified to support SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019 as the publication and subscription database. |
| Enhancement | The `validatepubs` and `validatepub` CLI commands no longer require the `-repgrouptype` option. |
| Enhancement | The `use-ora-case` option has been added to the Data Validator tool to enforce usage of the same case for the tables specified using the `include-tables` option, irrespective of the default case in the source and target databases. See [Performing data validation](../09_data_validator/02_perform_datavalidation) for more information. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed issue so that the replication history is loaded properly in the Replication console for SMR + MMR cluster at publication service startup [Support Ticket #74217]. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue that caused a failure when loading the `pgShadowTableQueryMode` configuration parameter [Support Ticket #78117]. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the publication server crash observed in a corner case on Windows when the Sync operation is performed for a WAL-based cluster [Support Ticket #79555].|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue that prevented adding PostgreSQL as a publication database when the controller database is EDB Postgres Advanced Server. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where an update-update conflict with a custom resolution strategy failed to resolve with EDB Postgres Advanced Server/PostgreSQL JDBC driver version 42.3.2 or later. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where the incorrect publication association is shown for a subscription. |
| Bug Fix | Report an error if the table name is not schema-qualified for the `createpub` CLI command. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue that prevented removal of a publication when a row filter is defined against it. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the snapshot failure for a SMR cluster with EDB Postgres Advanced Server publication database (created with the `no-redwood-compat` option) and PostgreSQL subscription database. |
