The following steps will walk you through using the EDB `apt` repository to install a Debian package.

!!! Note
    You can also visit <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/> and select the platform and product to view the steps for installation.

1.  Log in as root on your Debian or Ubuntu host:

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Configure the EDB repository:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com $(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    Where `username:password` is to be replaced by the credentials provided by EDB. To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add â€“
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM server:

    ```text
    apt-get install edb-pem
    ```

    !!! Note
        The operating system user `pem` gets created while installing the PEM Server. The PEM Server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session gets saved to this user's home directory.

When the installation completes, you must configure the PEM Server. For detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](05_configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).
