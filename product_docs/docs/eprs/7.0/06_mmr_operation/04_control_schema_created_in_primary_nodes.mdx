<div id="control_schema_created_in_primary_nodes" class="registered_link"></div>

Creating primary nodes creates control schema objects in each primary node database.

See [Control schema objects created for a publication](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/04_control_schema_objects_created_for_publication/#control_schema_objects_created_for_publication) for the control schema objects created in each primary node.

Don't delete any of these control schema objects as the replication system metadata will become corrupted.

When you remove a primary node using the Replication Server console or CLI, all of its control schema objects are deleted from that primary node database.
