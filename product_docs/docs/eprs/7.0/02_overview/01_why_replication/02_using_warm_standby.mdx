When organizations want to improve the availability of their data, one cost-effective solution is to use warm standby servers. These are database servers kept up to date with the online system through replication. You can bring these servers online quickly when a failure occurs in the production system. You can also use warm standby servers for regular maintenance by switching over to the standby server so that you can take the production server offline for regular maintenance.
