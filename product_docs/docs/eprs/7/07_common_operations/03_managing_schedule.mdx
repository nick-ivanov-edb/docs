After you create a schedule, Replication Server performs replications according to the schedule until you update or remove the schedule.

Updating or removing a schedule doesn't affect a replication that already started. If a replication is in progress when the schedule is updated or removed, the in-progress replication continues until completion.

## Update a schedule

To change an existing schedule for SMR:

1.  Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you want to change is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a subscription server](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) to learn how to start and register a subscription server.

1.  Select the Subscription node of the subscription whose schedule you want to update.

1.  Select **Subscription > Schedule > Configure Schedule**.

1.  In the Configure Scheduler confirmation box, select **Yes**.

1.  In the Scheduled Task Wizard dialog box, create the new schedule. See [Creating a schedule](02_creating_schedule/#creating_schedule) for details.

To change an existing schedle for MMR:

1.  Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the controller database you want to change is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a publication server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn how to start and register a publication server.

1.  Select the Publication Database node designated as the controller database whose schedule you want to update. From the context menu, select **Configure Schedule**.

1.  In the Configure Scheduler confirmation box, select **Yes**.

1.  In the Scheduled Task Wizard dialog box, create the new schedule. See [Creating a schedule](02_creating_schedule/#creating_schedule) for details.
