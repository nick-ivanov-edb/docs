Depending on the multi-master replication system environment, you might need certain configuration settings for the conflict resolution process to operate properly.

The following are required only for the log-based method. These do not apply to the trigger-based method.

-   `track_commit_timestamp`. Any Postgres 9.6 and later database server containing a primary node must have its `track_commit_timestamp` configuration parameter enabled. The `track_commit_timestamp` parameter is located in the `postgresql.conf` file. If `track_commit_timestamp` isn't enabled, then update/update conflicts aren't automatically resolved such as by using the earliest timestamp of the conflicting transactions. As a result, these conflicting transactions are left in a pending state. See [Automatic conflict resolution example](07_auto_conflict_resolution_eg/#auto_conflict_resolution_eg) for an example of how update/update conflicts are automatically resolved.
-   `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`. If `update/update conflicts` are expected to occur on a given publication table, then you must set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` setting for the table to `FULL` on every primary node. The case where update transactions occur on separate primary nodes but updating different columns in the same row isn't considered an update/update conflict. However, if `REPLICA IDENTITY` isn't set to `FULL`, then this case is recorded as an update/update conflict.

Set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` option to `FULL` using the `ALTER TABLE` command as shown by the following:

```text
ALTER TABLE schema.table_name REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
```

The following is an example of the `ALTER TABLE` command:

```text
ALTER TABLE edb.dept REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
```

You can display the `REPLICA IDENTITY` setting with the `PSQL` utility using the `\d+` command:

```text
edb=# \d+ edb.dept
                                  Table "edb.dept"
 Column |         Type          | Modifiers | Storage  | Stats target | Description
--------+-----------------------+-----------+----------+--------------+-------------
 deptno | numeric(2,0)          | not null  | main     |              |
 dname  | character varying(14) |           | extended |              |
 loc    | character varying(13) |           | extended |              |
Indexes:
    "dept_pk" PRIMARY KEY, btree (deptno)
    "dept_dname_uq" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (dname)
Referenced by:
    TABLE "emp" CONSTRAINT "emp_ref_dept_fk" FOREIGN KEY (deptno) REFERENCES dept(deptno)
    TABLE "jobhist" CONSTRAINT "jobhist_ref_dept_fk" FOREIGN KEY (deptno) REFERENCES dept(deptno) ON DELETE SET NULL
Replica Identity: FULL
```

!!! Note
    In addition to conflict resolution requirements, you might need the `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` setting on publication tables for other reasons in Replication Server. See [Table settings and restrictions for table filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_settings_and_restrictions_for_table_filters) for additional requirements.
