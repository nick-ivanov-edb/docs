The `edb-pem` package for Linux platforms installs the PEM Server, a PEM Agent, and the required software to connect to the PEM web interface with a supported browser.

The PEM server uses a Postgres installation and backend database to manage data. The `pem` backend database is created when you configure PEM.

For detailed information about installing the PEM Server, see [Installing the PEM server on Linux](03_installing_pem_server_using_edb_repository). For information about configuring a PEM Server see [Configuring the PEM server on Linux](05_configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).

The PEM Agent that is installed with the PEM server is capable of monitoring multiple servers that reside on the same host, or on remote hosts. Please note that the PEM functionality on servers monitored by a remote Agent may be limited. For detailed information about remote monitoring functionality see the [PEM agent privileges](/pem/latest/pem_online_help/02_toc_pem_agent/05_pem_agent_privileges/).

For detailed information about installing and configuring a PEM Agent, see [Installing the PEM agent on Linux](08_installing_pem_agent_using_edb_repository).

For troubleshooting the installation or configuration of the PEM Server, see [Troubleshooting](/pem/latest/04_troubleshooting)
