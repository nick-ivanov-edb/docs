After you create a publication and subscription, you can start the replication process in either of these ways:

-   You can perform replication immediately by taking an on-demand snapshot.
-   You can schedule replication to start later by creating a schedule. See [Creating a schedule](../../07_common_operations/02_creating_schedule/#creating_schedule).
