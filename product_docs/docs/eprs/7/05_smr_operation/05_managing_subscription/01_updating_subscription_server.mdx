When you register a subscription server in the Replication Server console, you can choose to save the subscription server’s network location (IP address and port number), admin user name, and encrypted password in a server login file on the computer on which you are running the Replication Server Console. See [Saving server login information](../../04_intro_xdb_console/#saving_server_login_info) for details.

To update the subscription server, first open the Replication Server console. The subscription server whose login information you want to alter in the server login file must appear as a Subscription Server node in the replication tree.

You can perform the following actions on the server login file:

-   Change the subscription server’s login information (host IP address, port number, admin user name, and password) that you last saved in the server login file.
-   Delete the subscription server’s login information that is currently saved in the server login file. This is the default action and requires you to register the subscription server again the next time you open the Replication Server console.
-   Resave the subscription server’s login information in the server login file. Each time you open the Update Subscription Server dialog box, you must choose to save the login information if you want it recorded in the server login file.

The following steps change only the content of the server login file residing on the host under the current Replication Server console user’s home directory. These changes don't alter any characteristic of the actual subscription server daemon (on Linux) or service (on Windows). These changes affect only how a subscription server is viewed through the Replication Server console on this host by this user.

The subscription server whose login information you want to save, change, or delete in the server login file must be running before you can make any changes to the file. See Step 1 of [Registering a subscription server](../03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for instructions on starting the subscription server.

1.  Right-click the Subscription Server node and select **Update**. 

1.  In the Update Subscription Server dialog box, complete the fields according to your purpose for updating the server login file:

    -   If the subscription server now runs on a host with a different IP address or port number from what is shown in the dialog box, enter the correct information. You must also enter the admin user name and password saved in the Replication Server configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address you entered in the **Host** field. Select **Save Login Information** if you want the new login information saved in the server login file. If you don't select this option, access to the subscription server is available for the current session, but for later sessions you must register the subscription server again.
    -   If you want to delete previously saved login information, make sure the network location shown in the dialog box is still correct. Reenter the admin user name and password saved in the Replication Server configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address in the **Host** field. Leave the **Save Login Information** box cleared. Access to the subscription server is available for this session, but for later sessions you must register the subscription server again.
    -   If you want to save the current login information shown in the dialog box, make sure the network location shown in the dialog box is correct. Reenter the admin user name and password saved in the Replication Server configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address in the **Host** field. Select **Save Login Information**.

1.  Select **Update**. The dialog box closes after the update to the server login file completes. Select **Refresh** in the tool bar to show the updated Subscription Server node.
