Replication Server performs two different types of replications. These two main types are called *snapshot replication* and *synchronization replication*.

In either method, the source tables refer to the tables from which the replication data is originating. In a single-master replication system, it's the publication. In a multi-master replication system it's the primary node whose changes are being replicated to another primary node.

The target tables are the tables that are receiving the replication data from the source tables. In a single-master replication system, it's the subscription tables. In a multi-master replication system, it's the primary node receiving changes from another primary node.

In snapshot replication, all existing rows in the target tables are deleted using the database systemâ€™s `TRUNCATE` command. The tables are then completely reloaded from the source tables of the publication.

In synchronization replication, only the changes (inserts, updates, and deletions) to the rows in the source tables since the last replication are applied to the target tables.

!!! Note
    Deleting all rows in a source table executed by the `SQL TRUNCATE` command results in replication to the target tables only if the log-based method of synchronization replication is used. If the trigger-based method of synchronization replication is used, executing the `TRUNCATE` command on a source table doesn't replicate the effect to the target tables. You must perform a snapshot from the source table to the target tables if you use the trigger-based method. 

Synchronization replication is implemented using two different methods: the trigger-based method and the log-based method.

In the trigger-based method, changes to rows in the source tables result in row-based triggers executing. These triggers record the changes in shadow tables. The changes recorded in the shadow tables are then periodically extracted from the shadow tables, converted to an in-memory data structure, and applied to the target tables by means of SQL statements executed using JDBC. See [Synchronization replication with the trigger-based method](09_sync_replication_trigger_based/#sync_replication_trigger_based) for information on the trigger-based method.

In the log-based method, changes to rows in the source tables are extracted from the write-ahead log segments (`WAL` files) using asynchronous streaming replication implemented by the logical decoding feature available in Postgres database servers. The extracted changes are converted to an in-memory data structure and applied to the target tables by means of SQL statements executed using JDBC. See [Synchronization replication with the log-based method](10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based) for information on the log-based method.

In a multi-master replication system, the manner in which changes accumulated on all primary nodes are replicated to all other primary nodes is conceptually done in groups identified by the source primary node with the changes to be replicated. See [Multi-master parallel replication](12_mmr_parallel_replication/#mmr_parallel_replication) for information on this process and the improvement for the log-based method with parallel replication.

In a single-master replication system, always do the first replication to a newly created subscription with a snapshot. You can perform subsequent replications by snapshot or by synchronization, provided that the publication isn't defined as a snapshot-only publication, as discussed in [Snapshot-only publications](07_snapshot_only_publications/#snapshot_only_publications).

In a multi-master replication system, you must do the first replication from the primary definition node to a newly added primary node with a snapshot. Subsequent replications between primary nodes occur by synchronization. However, it is possible to perform subsequent snapshots from the primary definition node to any other primary node.
