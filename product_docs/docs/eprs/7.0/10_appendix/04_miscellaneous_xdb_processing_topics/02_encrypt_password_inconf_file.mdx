If you need to change the password in the Replication Server configuration file, you must first encrypt the password. Use the `encrypt` command of the Replication Server CLI to generate the encrypted form of the password from its plain text form given in an input file.

1.  Create a text file with the password you want to encrypt. Don't leave any white space before or after the password.

    The following example shows the text `newpassword` in the input file `passfile`:

    ```text
    $ cat passfile
    newpassword
    $
    ```

1.  Use the `edb-repcli.jar` file to execute the Replication Server CLI with the `encrypt` command by first including the Java bin directory in your `PATH` environment variable and making `XDB_HOME/bin` your current working directory.

    For example, assuming `/usr/bin` contains the Java executable program and Replication Server is installed into the `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME` directory, perform the following:

    ```text
    $ export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
    $ cd /opt/PostgresPlus/9.4AS/bin
    $ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/passfile -output ~/encrypted
    The following shows the encrypted form of the password in the output file encrypted:
    $ cat ~/encrypted
    4mKq/4jQQoV2IypCSmPpTQ==
    $
    ```

1.  Copy and paste the encrypted password into the Replication Server configuration file.

    ```text
    #xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
    #Thu Sep 03 11:13:27 GMT-05:00 2015
    admin_password=4mKq/4jQQoV2IypCSmPpTQ==
    admin_user=admin
    ```
