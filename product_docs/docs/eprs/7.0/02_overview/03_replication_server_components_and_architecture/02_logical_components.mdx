<div id="logical_components" class="registered_link"></div>

Logical components are created when you build a replication system using the Replication Server console or the Replication Server CLI. The logical components are stored as part of the replication system metadata in the control schema of the publication databases.

To create a replication system, you must:

-   Register a publication server.
-   Create a publication database definition.
-   Create a publication.

For a single-master replication system, you then must:

-   Register a subscription server.
-   Create a subscription database definition.
-   Create a subscription.

For a multi-master replication system, you create additional primary nodes by creating additional publication database definitions.

Each of these steps creates a logical component that is represented by a node in the replication tree of the  Replication Server console. See [Introduction to the Replication Server Console](../../04_intro_xdb_console/#intro_xdb_console) for a detailed description of the Replication Server console. 

## Publication server

The first step in creating a publication is to identify the publication server to use to manage the publication. This process is called registering the publication server.

Using the Replication Server console or the Replication Server CLI, register a publication server by giving the IP address and port number of the host on which the publication server is running. Also give the admin user name and password stored in the Replication Server configuration file located on the host running the publication server. (This information is determined during the publication server installation process.)

When viewed in the Replication Server console, a registered publication server appears under the top level Replication Servers node in the replication tree. All publication-related logical components are created subordinate to a registered publication server and appear underneath it in the replication tree.

[Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) gives instructions for registering a publication server for a single-master replication system. See [Registering a publication server](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#registering_pub_server) for a multi-master replication system.

## Replication system type (SMR/MMR)

Subordinate to a registered publication server, two nodes representing the replication system type appear. One is identified by the label SMR for single-master replication and the other has the label MMR for multi-master replication.

If you're creating a single-master replication system, you proceed to add logical components under the SMR type node.

If you're creating a multi-master replication system, you proceed to add logical components under the MMR type node.

## Publication database definition

You can create one or more publication database definitions subordinate to one of the Replication System Type nodes under a registered publication server. 

A publication database definition identifies a database whose tables and views to use in a publication. The identifying information consists of the database server IP address, port number, a database user name and password, and the database identifier.

The publication server uses this information to connect to the publication database to create the replication system control schema in the publication database and perform the replications.

Though the process of creating a publication database definition is similar for single-master and multi-master replication systems, their usage in the replication system is somewhat different.

In a single-master replication system, a publication database definition identifies the storage area of one or more publications, each of which is eventually associated with its own subscription in a primary-to-secondary relationship.

In a multi-master replication system, each publication database definition subordinate to the MMR type node of a given publication server identifies a primary node in a single, multi-master replication system.

!!! Note
    Currently, you can have only one multi-master replication system per publication server.

[Adding a publication catabase](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database) discusses creating a publication database definition for a single-master replication system. See [Adding the primary definition node](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn) and [Creating additional primary nodes](../../06_mmr_operation/03_creating_primary_nodes/#creating_primary_nodes) for a multi-master replication system.

## Publication

You can define one or more publicaitons subordinate to a publication database definition in a single-master replication system. A publication contains a list of tables and views to replicate to a subscription database.

In a single-master replication system, the database user name specified in the publication database definition of the publication’s parent, as viewed in the replication tree, must have the `SELECT` object privilege on any table or view to include in the publication.

You can define only one publication subordinate to a publication database definition in a multi-master replication system. The publication contains the list of tables to replicate and keep synchronized in the primary nodes of the multi-master replication system.

In a multi-master replication system, the database user name specified in the publication database definition of the publication’s parent, as viewed in the replication tree, must have superuser privileges and be the owner of all tables to be included in the publication.

[Adding a publication](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) discusses creating a publication for a single-master replication system. See [Adding a publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr) for a multi-master replication system.

## Subscription server

!!! Note
    The subscription server applies only to single-master replication systems. You don't register a subscription server when creating a multi-master replication system.

The first step in creating a subscription is to identify the subscription server to use to manage the subscription. This process is called registering the subscription server.

Using the Replication Server console or the Replication Server CLI, register a subscription server by giving the IP address and port number of the host on which the subscription server is running. Also give the admin user name and password stored in the Replication Server configuration file located on the host running the subscription server. This information is determined during the subscription server installation process.

When viewed in the Replication Server console, a registered subscription server appears under the top-level Replication Servers node in the replication tree. All subscription-related logical components are created subordinate to a registered subscription server and appear underneath it in the replication tree. [Registering a subscription server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) gives detailed instructions.

## Subscription database definition

!!! Note
    The subscription database definition applies only to single-master replication systems. You don't create a subscription database definition when creating a multi-master replication system.

Create one or more subscription database definitions subordinate to a registered subscription server.

A subscription database definition identifies a database to which to replicate a publication’s tables and views. The identify information consists of:
-  The database server IP address 
-  Port number
-  A database user name and password
-  the database identifier

The subscription server uses this information to connect to the subscription database to create the table definitions.

The publication server also uses this information to connect to the subscription database when it performs replications.

[Adding a subscription database](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/02_adding_subscription_database/#adding_subscription_database) discusses creating a subscription database definition.

## Subscription

!!! Note
    The subscription applies only to single-master replication systems. You don't create a subscription when creating a multi-master replication system.

You can define one or more subscriptions subordinate to a subscription database definition. A subscription associates a publication to a subscription database to which to replicate the publication’s tables and views.

You can associate each subscription with only one publication.

For details, see [Adding a subscription](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/03_adding_subscription/#adding_subscription).
