Replication Server works with Linux and Windows systems. However, we show directory paths in the Linux format with forward slashes. When working on Windows systems, start the directory path with the drive letter followed by a colon, and substitute back slashes for forward slashes.

Much of this documentation about Replication Server applies to PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. We use the term Postgres to refer to both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Only when a distinction needs to be made are the full names used.

The installation directory path of the PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server products is referred to as `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME`. 
-  For PostgreSQL Linux installations, this path defaults to `/opt/PostgreSQL/x.x` for version 10 and earlier. For later versions, use the PostgreSQL community packages. 
-  For PostgreSQL Windows installations, this path defaults to `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\x.x`. -  For EDB Postgres Advanced Server Linux installations performed using the interactive installer for version 10 and earlier, this path defaults to `/opt/PostgresPlus/x.xAS or /opt/edb/asx.x`. 
-  For EDB Postgres Advanced Server Linux installations performed using an RPM package, this path defaults to `/usr/ppas-x.x or /usr/edb/asx.x`. 
-  For EDB Postgres Advanced Server Windows installations, this path defaults to `C:\Program Files\PostgresPlus\x.xAS` or `C:\Program Files\edb\asx.x`. The product version number is represented by `x.x` or by `xx` for version 10 and later.
