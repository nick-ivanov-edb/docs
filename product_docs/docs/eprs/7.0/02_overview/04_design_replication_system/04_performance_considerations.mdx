Keep these general guidelines for performance in mind as you design your replication system.

## When to use snapshot or synchronization

Generally, synchronization is the quickest replication method since it applies changes to the target tables only since the last replication occurred.

However, suppose a large percentage of rows change between each replication. At some point it might be faster to completely reload the target tables using a snapshot than to execute individual SQL statements on a large percentage of rows as with synchronization replication. You might need to experiment to determine if, and at what point, a snapshot is faster.

Snapshot replication might be an option for tables with the following characteristics:

-   Tables are relatively small
-   A large percentage of rows change between replications

Synchronization replication is the better option for tables with the following characteristics:

-   Tables are large
-   A small percentage of rows change between replications

In a single-master replication system, you might find that one group of tables consistently replicates faster using snapshot replication. In this case, you can make these tables part of a snapshot-only publication while the remaining tables are members of a publication that uses synchronization replication.

## When to use on-demand replication

The Replication Server console and CLI both enable you to immediately start a replication. This ability is called on-demand replication.

You can perform on-demand replication at any time regardless of whether there's an existing schedule. An on-demand replication doesn't change the date and time when the next replication will occur according to an existing schedule.

If a publication is a snapshot-only publication, then the only type of on-demand replication that you can perform on the publication is a snapshot.

If a publication is not a snapshot-only publication, you can perform an on-demand replication using either the snapshot method or the synchronization method.

When you're in the development and testing phases of your replication system, you typically use on-demand replication so that you can immediately force the replication to occur and analyze the results.

When your replication system is ready for production, you typically use a schedule so that replications can occur unattended at regular time intervals. See [Creating a schedule](../../07_common_operations/02_creating_schedule/#creating_schedule).

In other situations, you want to force a replication to take place ahead of its normal schedule. Reasons for performing an on-demand replication include the following:

-   The number of changes to the source tables is growing at a faster rate than usual, and you don't want to wait for the regularly scheduled synchronization time to replicate all of the accumulated changes.
-   You set up your replication system to perform synchronizations, but an unusually large number of changes were made to the source tables. You want to perform a snapshot of all source tables rather than execute a large number of SQL statements against the target tables.
-   Changes were made directly to the rows of the target tables so that they no longer have the same content as their source table counterparts. You can perform an on-demand snapshot replication to reload all rows of the target tables from your current set of source tables.

!!! Note
    In a multi-master replication system, you can make on-demand snapshots only from the primary definition node to another primary node.

See [On-demand replication](../../05_smr_operation/04_on_demand_replication/#on_demand_replication) for information on performing an on-demand replication for a single-master replication system. See [On-demand replication](../../06_mmr_operation/05_on_demand_replication_mmr/#on_demand_replication_mmr) for a multi-master replication system.
