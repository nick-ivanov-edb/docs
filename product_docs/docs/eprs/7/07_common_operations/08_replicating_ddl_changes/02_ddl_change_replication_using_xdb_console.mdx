You can apply DDL change replication using the Replication Server console as follows:

1.  If you plan to use a file to supply the `ALTER TABLE` statements to a publication table, prepare the text file. Make sure this text file is accessible by the operating system account with which you open the Replication Server console.

    Alternatively, you can copy and paste or directly type the `ALTER TABLE` statements into the Alter Publication Table dialog box without having to save the statements in a file.

1.  Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication containing the table you want to change is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn how to start and register a publication server.

1.  Under the publication database of a single-master replication system, or under the primary definition node of a multi-master replication system, open the Alter Publication Table dialog box. From the context menu of the Table node of the table you want to modify, select **Alter Table**.

1.  In the Alter Publication Table dialog box, if you saved the `ALTER TABLE` statements in a text file, make sure the DDL Script File option is selected, browse for this file, and select **OK**.

    Alternatively, if you are directly entering the `ALTER TABLE` statements, select the **DDL Script** option instead of the **DDL Script File** option. Directly type or copy and paste the `ALTER TABLE` statements from your source into the text box and then selecting **OK**.

1.  When DDL Replicated Successfully appears, the DDL change was successful across all databases. Select **OK**.

If DDL replication wasn't successful, you must investigate and resolve the problem on a case-by-case basis. Factors to look for include the following:

-   Were the modifications in the `ALTER TABLE` statements successfully applied to the target table in each database of the replication system?
-   For the trigger-based method, were the replication triggers on the target table modified to account for the `ALTER TABLE` statements?
-   For the trigger-based method, was the shadow table `RRST_schema_table` located in the `_edb_replicator_pub` schema in each database of the replication system modified to account for the `ALTER TABLE` statements?

If it is apparent that the replication system isn't in a consistent state regarding the table definitions, see [Validating a publication](../06_managing_publication/05_validating_publication/#validating_publication) for guidance on how to deal with these issues.
