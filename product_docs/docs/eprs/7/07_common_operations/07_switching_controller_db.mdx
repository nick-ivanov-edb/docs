The controller database is designated in the Replication Server Configuration file and determines the publication database to which the publication server and subscription server first connect on startup. See [Controller database](../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#controller_database) and [Replication Server configuration file](../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file) for more information.

You can't remove the current controller database from a replication system unless it's the last publication database remaining subordinate to the publication server. In other words, no other publication databases are managed by the publication server.

With more than one publication databases, if you want to remove the publication database currently designated as the controller database, you must first set another publication database as the controller. Then you can remove the publication database previously designated as the controller.

The publication database used as the controller can be the primary database of any single-master replication system or any primary node of a multi-master replication system. Any database type (Oracle, SQL Server, or Postgres) is acceptable as the controller database.

!!! Note
    If the controller database is an Oracle or a SQL Server publication database, you can't add a second Oracle or SQL Server publication database to create a second single-master replication system. For Replication Server to run more than one single-master replication systems consisting of Oracle or SQL Server publication databases, you must designate a Postgres publication database as the controller database.

Once you have multiple Oracle or SQL Server publication databases set up in single-master replication systems with a Postgres controller database, don't switch the controller database to an Oracle or SQL Server publication database.

Upon switching the controller database, the publication server updates the Replication Server configuration file so the parameters `user`, `password`, `host`, `port`, `database`, and `type` are set to the connection and authentication settings for the selected publication database.

To set another publication database as the controller database:

1.  Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication databases is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a publication server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn how to start and register a publication server.

1.  Select the Publication Database node corresponding to the publication database that you want to set as the controller database.

1.  From the context menu, select **Set as Controller Database**.

1.  In the Set as Controller Database confirmation box, select **Yes**.

    The selected publication database is now set as the controller database.

    The value **Yes** in the **Controller Database** field of the Property window indicates this database is the controller database.

The following shows the Replication Server configuration file after the controller database was switched to the primary node database `MMRnode_b`.
