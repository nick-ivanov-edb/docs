**For SMR only:** The `createsub` command creates a new subscription.

## Synopsis

```text
-createsub subname
  -subsvrfile subsvrfile
  -subdbid dbid
  -pubsvrfile pubsvrfile
  -pubname pubname
[ -filterrule filterid_1[,filterid_2 ] ...]
```

The `createsub` command adds a subscription subordinate to the subscription database definition with the subscription database ID given by parameter `subdbid.`

See [Adding a subscription](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/03_adding_subscription/#adding_subscription) for more information.

## Parameters

`subname`

The subscription name for the new subscription.

`subsvrfile`

The file containing the subscription server login information of the subscription server under which the new subscription is subordinate.

`dbid`

The subscription database ID of the subscription database definition to which to add the subscription subordinate to.

`pubsvrfile`

The file containing the publication server login information of the publication server under which the publication is subordinate. This is the publication the new subscription is associated with.

`pubname`
 The publication to which to associate the new subscription.

`filterid_n`

Comma-separated list of filter IDs identifying the filter rules from the set of available table filters to enable on the corresponding tables in the new subscription. Use the `printpubfilterslist` command to obtain the filter IDs for the available filter rules in the publication (see [Printing a list of filters in a Publication](17_print_publications_filters_list/#print_publications_filters_list)). Don't use white space between the comma and filter IDs.

## Examples

This example creates a subscription named `dept_emp_sub` in the EDB Postgres Advanced Server subscription database identified by subscription database ID 2. The subscription is associated with a publication named `dept_emp`.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -createsub dept_emp_sub \
>   -subsvrfile ~/subsvrfile.prop \
>   -subdbid 2 \
>   -pubsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -pubname dept_emp
