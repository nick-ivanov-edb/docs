When you create a publication database definition, you save the publication database server’s network location (IP address and port number), the database identifier, a database login user name, and the user’s password in the control schema accessed by the publication server. This login information is used whenever you need to establish a session with the publication database. See [Adding a publication database](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database) for information on creating a publication database definition for a single-master replication system. See [Adding the primary definition node](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn) and [Creating more primary nodes](../../06_mmr_operation/03_creating_primary_nodes/#creating_primary_nodes) for a multi-master replication system.

You can update the publication database login information stored in the control schema if any of these attributes of the physical database change.

!!! Note
    Depending on the database type (Oracle, SQL Server, or Postgres), you must not change certain attributes. Don't change any attribute that modifies access to the schema where the control schema objects were created when you originally added this publication database definition. See [Control schema objects created for a publication](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/04_control_schema_objects_created_for_publication/#control_schema_objects_created_for_publication) for the location of the control schema objects.

Don't change the following attributes:

-   The Oracle login user name of an Oracle publication database as the control schema objects already reside in this Oracle user’s schema
-   The database server network location if the new network location references a database server that doesn't access the publication database where the control schema objects are stored
-   The database identifier if the new database identifier references a different physical database than where the control schema objects are stored

You can change the following attributes:

-   The login user name’s password to match a changed database user password
-   The database server network location if the corresponding location change was made to the database server that accesses the publication database
-   The database identifier such as the Oracle service name, SQL Server database name, or Postgres database name if the corresponding name change was made on the database server

To update a publication database: 

1.  Make sure the database server that you want to save as the publication database definition is running and accepting client connections.

1.  Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication database definition you want to change is running and registered in the Replication Server console you're using. See [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn how to start and register a publication server.

1.  Select the Publication Database node corresponding to the publication database definition that you want to update.

1.  Select **Publication > Publication Database > Update Database**. 

1.  In the Update Database Source dialog box, enter the desired changes. See [Adding a publication database](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database) for the meanings of the fields for a single-master replication system. See [Adding the primary definition node](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn) and [Creating more primary nodes](../../06_mmr_operation/03_creating_primary_nodes/#creating_primary_nodes) for a multi-master replication system.

1.  Select **Test**. When Test Result: Success appears, select **OK**, and then select **Save**.

1.  Restart the publication server. See [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for information on restarting the publication server.

1.  Select the **Refresh** icon in the tool bar to show the updated Publication Database node and any of its publications.
