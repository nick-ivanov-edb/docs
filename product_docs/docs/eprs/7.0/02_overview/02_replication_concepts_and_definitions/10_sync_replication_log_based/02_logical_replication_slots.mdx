<div id="logical_replication_slots" class="registered_link"></div>

When using the log-based method on a publication database, the underlying logical decoding framework exposes the data changes (the changeset stream) by means of a logical replication slot.

A logical replication slot represents a changeset stream and applies to a single database. Replication Server assigns a unique identifier, called the slot name, to each logical replication slot it creates in the form `xdb_<dboid>_<pubid>` where `<dboid>` is the publication database object identifier (OID) and `<pubid>` is the publication ID assigned by Replication Server. All slot names are unique in a Postgres database cluster.

Thus, for each single-master replication system using the log-based method, a replication slot is required for the publication database of each such system.

For a multi-master replication system using the log-based method, each primary node requires a replication slot.

The maximum number of replication slots permitted for a database server is controlled by the `max_replication_slots` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file. Therefore, you must set this configuration parameter to a value large enough to account for:
-  All publication databases defined with the log-based method of single-master replication systems running on the database server. 
-  All primary nodes of a multi-master replication system defined with the log-based method running on the database server. 

Additional replication slots are required to support the use of replication origin (see [Replication origin](04_replication_origin/#replication_origin)). 

For more information on configuration parameters for single-master replication systems, see [Enabling synchronization replication with the log-based method](../../../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/02_enable_sync_replication_with_log-based_method/#enable_sync_replication_with_log-based_method). 

For multi-master replication systems, see [Enabling synchronization replication with the log-based method](../../../06_mmr_operation/01_pre_steps/#enabling_sync_replication_log-based_method_mmr).
