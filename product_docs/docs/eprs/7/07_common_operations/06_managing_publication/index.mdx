After you create a publication, certain aspects of the underlying replication system environment might change for any number of reasons. Attributes that might change include the network location of the publication database server, the network location of the host running the publication server, database or operating system user names and passwords, and so forth.

This information is saved in the replication system metadata when you create a publication. Changes to these attributes result in inaccurate replication system metadata, which in turn can result in errors during subsequent replication attempts or replication system administration.

You can update the metadata stored for the publication server, the publication database definition, and publications to keep the information consistent with the actual replication system environment.
