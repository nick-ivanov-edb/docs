The first user of BigAnimal is granted the role of an *Account Owner*. As the account owner, you:

[Set up your identity provider]()
[Set up your cloud service provider]()

When you access BigAnimal for the first time you are brought to the Welcome page where you start the process of setting up your identify provider (IDP) and your cloud service provider (CSP). 

## Set up your identity provider
BigAnimal supports Single-Sign On through SAML identify providers. The SAML application enables access to BigAnimal for groups selected within your identify provider. To set up your identity provider:


1. In the **Set Up Identity Provider** page, enter the configuration information for your preferred SAML identity provider on the **Setup Config** tab:

   | Field | Description |
   | ----- | ----------- |
   | Issuer URL | URL string uniquely associated with your identity provider partner. |
   | Single Sign-On URL | |
   | Identity provider signature certificate | Identity provider's assertion signing certificate (.cer or .cert). Coordinate with your identity provider partner to obtain this certificate securely. Or can either choose the file or copy the contents directly. |
   | Request Binding | SAML Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send the authentication request (HTTP or HTTP POST). |
   | Response Signature Algorithm (RSA) Algorithm | The signature algorithm used to sign the SAML AuthNRequest (SHA or SHA-256). |

1. On the **Connection Info** tab, copy the following URLs to complete your identity provider setup:  
   
   | URL                            | Description |
   | ------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | Assertion Consumer Service URL | BigAnimal specific URL to which SAML assertions from your identity provider are sent. |
   | Audience URI                   | The entity or audience for which the SAML Assertion is intended. |

1. Configure your identity provider to send the SAML response in the following format:
   - Provide an `NameID` element within the `Subject` element.
   - Provide your email ID as the value to `NameID`. BigAnimal uses the email ID you provide as your username and primary email.
   - The SAML response must include the following attributes:
   - `givenname`: BigAnimal uses the value as the given name in the profile of the authenticated user.
   - `surname`: BigAnimal uses the value as the surname in the profile of the authenticated user.

   For example:

   ```
   TBD
   ```
1. Select **Test Connection**. If you connected to your identity provider successfully, you are brought to the BigAnimal log in screen. If not, an error message displays. You can check your configuration and try again. If issues persist, contact Support. 

Once you set your identity provider is set up, you can view your connection status, ID, login URL, audience URI, and assertion consumer service URL on the **Admin > Identity Provider** page.

## Set up your cloud service provider

TBD HOW THIS WORKS IN THE UI

EDB provides a shell script that checks whether requirements and resource limits are met in your cloud before linking to BigAnimal. An account owner or any other user can run EDB's setup script.

When you first log into BigAnimal:

1. Open the cloud shell in your browser.

1. Run the following command:

 **For Azure**

 **For AWS**

1. Input your cloud provider and account ID or subscription ID. The script sets up the boundary policy, designates the role and access BigAnimal should have to your Cloud Provider, and checks and raises account limits as needed.

## What's next

### Log in

If you filled in the parameters correctly, you can now log in to your BigAnimal account using your email ID.

## Import users

A user who is added in the identity provider is automatically added to BigAnimal. Users are typically invited by the identity provider and BigAnimal assigns them with the default role of reader. You can then manage roles and permissions from BigAnimal, see [Managing portal access](../../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/). 

!!! Note
    
    A user is only created in BigAnimal once they have logged in. If they have never logged in, they won’t show up in the user list and therefore their BigAnimal role can’t be changed (until they log in).
