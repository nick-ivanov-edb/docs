Before you begin manual resolution correction, it's important to determine the extent of the inconsistencies that occurred in the publication tables across the primary nodes of the replication system.

The **Conflict History** tab and the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../09_manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method/01_find_conflict/#find_conflict) can help determine the source of an initial conflict.

However, once this conflict occurs, your replication system might have processed and replicated more transactions during that synchronization operation. Some of these later replications might have succeeded, but others might have failed or produced unexpected results because of the prior conflict. With a replication schedule in effect, more synchronization operations can occur, which can create more conflicts.

Therefore, when you discovered that a conflict occurred, we recommended that you stop the publication server. Use the stop option of the Linux scripts or Windows services described in Step 1 of [Registering a publication server](../../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server). 

In this way, you can carefully analyze the content of the publication tables in question as well as any pending transactions in the shadow tables. This approach helps you to determine the best course of action without continued updates by the running replication system.

When analyzing your tables, you must determine which publication tables contain inconsistent rows across primary nodes (that is, missing rows on some primary nodes or rows with different column values for the same primary key on different primary nodes).

The general steps to resolving the problem following this analysis are:

1.  Make the needed manual corrections to the rows in the publication tables across all primary nodes to get them into an initial, consistent state so each publication table has the same set of identical rows across primary nodes. This might be to a state before the conflicting transactions occurred, depending on what you determine is the easiest course of action for fully resolving the conflict.

1.  Apply transactions (either from your application or from transaction blocks as defined in [Conflict resolution concept for the log-based method](02_conflict_resolution_for_log_based/#conflict_resolution_for_log_based)) so that all publication tables across all primary nodes are updated consistently according to the desired, expected result.

1.  In the control schema, update certain indicators for the conflicting entries to show that these conflicts are resolved. This update changes the Resolution Status of these entries to Resolved in the **Conflict History** tab. These entries no longer appear in the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict).

     Perform these updates to the control schema of the controller database. You can determine the currently designated controller database from the content of the Replication Server configuration file (see [xDB replication configuration rile](../../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file)). The publication server ensures that the control schema changes made on the controller database are replicated to the control schemas of all publication databases to maintain metadata consistency across all publication databases.

1.  Resume operating your replication system. Start the publication server and re-create the replication schedule if you were using one.

For accomplishing steps 1 and 2, use some combination of the following methods. The methods you use depends upon the state of your publication tables.

-   **Manual publication table correction.** Use a utility such as `PSQL` or `pgAdmin` (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server) to manually correct the rows in the publication tables across all primary nodes without replicating these changes. Apply these manual corrections in the transaction block described in [Conflict resolution concept for the log-based method](02_conflict_resolution_for_log_based/#conflict_resolution_for_log_based).
-   **Correction using new transactions.** To create new transactions that you allow to replicate to all other primary nodes, rerun your application on one primary node. Use this method after you ensure that all publication tables are in a consistent state across all primary nodes.

In the description of these methods, the following replication environment is used.

-   A three-node multi-master replication system is established. The primary node names are `MMRnode_a` (the primary definition node and the controller database), `MMRnode_b`, and `MMRnode_c`.
-   The publication is named `emp_pub` and uses the dept and emp tables.
-   The conflict used to show the conflict resolution methods is a uniqueness conflict occurring on the dept table on primary key column `deptno` on value 50. This conflict is a result of the `INSERT` statements shown by the following:

On `MMRnode_a`, the following statement is run:

```text
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'FINANCE', 'CHICAGO');
On MMRnode_b, the following statement is run:
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
```

A synchronization replication is then performed.

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_a`:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)
```

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_b`:

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_c`:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

The **Conflict History** tab shows the following entry:

The following is the output from the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../09_manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method/01_find_conflict/#find_conflict).
