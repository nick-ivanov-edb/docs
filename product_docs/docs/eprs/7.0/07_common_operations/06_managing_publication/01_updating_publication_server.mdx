Two aspects of metadata relate to the publication server that you might need update, depending on the change in the host environment:

-   If the network location (IP address or port number), admin user name, or password of the publication server changes, and if you have saved this information in the server login file, you need to update the server login file with the new information.
-   If the network location (IP address or port number) of a subscription server changes, then for each publication server managing a publication associated with a subscription of the changed subscription server, you must update the publication server’s metadata with the subscription server’s new network location. This type of update applies only to single-master replication systems.

## Update the publication server login file

When you register a publication server in the Replication Server console, you can save the publication server’s network location, admin user name, and encrypted password in a server login file on the computer on which you are running the Replication Server console. See [Saving server login information](../../04_intro_xdb_console/#saving_server_login_info) for details.

Open the Replication Server console. To perform the update, the publication server whose login information you want to modify in the server login file must appear as a Publication Server node in the replication tree.

You can perform the following actions on the server login file:

-   Change the publication server’s login information (host IP address, port number, admin user name, and password) that you last saved in the server login file.
-   Delete the publication server’s login information that is currently saved in the server login file. This is the default action, which requires you to register the publication server again the next time you open the Replication Server console.
-   Resave the publication server’s login information in the server login file. Each time you open the Update Publication Server dialog box, you must choose to save the login information if you want it recorded in the server login file.

Updating the publication server login file changes only the content of the server login file residing on the host under the current Replication Server console user’s home directory. These changes don't change any characteristic of the actual publication server daemon (on Linux) or service (on Windows). These changes affect only how a publication server is viewed through the Replication Server console on this host by this user.

1.  Make sure the publication server whose login information you want to save, change, or delete in the server login file is running. See [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn how to start the publication server.

1.  On the Publication Server node, select **Update** from the context menu. 

1.  In the Update Publication Server dialog box, complete the fields according to your needs:

    -   If the publication server now runs on a host with a different IP address or port number than what is shown in the dialog box, enter the correct information. You must also enter the admin user name and password saved in the Replication Server configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address you entered in the **Host** field. Select **Save Login Information** if you want the new login information saved in the server login file. If you don't select this option, access to the publication server is available for the current session: future sessions will require you to register the publication server again.
    -   If you want to delete previously saved login information, make sure the network location shown in the dialog box is still correct. Reenter the admin user name and password saved in the Replication Server configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address in the **Host** field. Leave the **Save Login Information** box cleared. Access to the publication server is available for this session, but future sessions will require you to register the publication server again.
    -   If you want to save the current login information shown in the dialog box, make sure the network location shown in the dialog box is correct. Reenter the admin user name and password saved in the Replication Server configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address in the **Host** field. Select **Save Login Information**.

1.  Select **Update**. When the dialog box closes, then the update to the server login file was successful. Select the **Refresh** icon in the tool bar to show the updated Publication Server node.

## Update subscription server network location

!!! Note
    Updating subscription server network location applies only to single-master replication systems.

Part of the metadata stored for each publication server is the network location of subscription servers that manage subscriptions associated with the publication server’s publications. This network information enables the publication server to communicate with the subscription server.

If the network location of a subscription server changes after subscriptions were created, you must update the publication server metadata with the new network location. Otherwise a communication failure occurs between the publication server and the subscription server and an error message appears.

To update the subscription server network location in a publication server’s metadata:

1.  Make sure the publication server whose metadata you want to change is running. See [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for more information.

1.  On the Publication Server node, select **Update Subscription Servers** from the context menu. 

1.  In the Update Subscription Servers dialog box, enter the new network location for each subscription server in the list whose network location has changed.

1.  Select **Update**. When the dialog box closes, then the update to the publication server’s metadata was successful.

1.  If the subscription server with the new network location manages subscriptions associated with publications in other publication servers, update those subscription servers as well.
