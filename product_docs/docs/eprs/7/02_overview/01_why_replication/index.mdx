<div id="why_replication" class="registered_link"></div>

You can use data replication in a variety of use cases in organizations where it's important to use the same data in multiple settings. This replication of data allows users to work with real data that yields real results that are reliable in more than one setting. Support of both single-master and multi-master replication gives Replication Server a broad range of supported use cases.
