<div id="creating_publication" class="registered_link"></div>

Creating your first publication requires the following steps:

-   Registering the publication server
-   Adding the publication database
-   Creating a publication by choosing the tables and views for the publication along with creating any optional filter clauses

After you add the publication database, you can create as many publications as there are available tables and views. These tables and views must be readable by the publication database user and meet the criteria outlined in [Design considerations](../../02_overview/04_design_replication_system/02_design_considerations/#design_considerations) and [Restrictions on replicated database objects](../../02_overview/04_design_replication_system/03_restrictions_on_replicated_database_objects/#restrictions_on_replicated_database_objects).
